1. TO THE READER.

#####Body#####

1. OF THE COVENANT OF WORKS.

    _ Part I.

      * Sect. 1. PROP. I. God the maker of all things, created man a rational being, after his own Image, he being created to know, acknowledge, love, worſhip, obey, and enjoy his Maker.

      * Sect. 2. PROP. II. The Great and Glorious God being Man's Creator, it follows by neceſſary and undeniable conſequence, that he is the abſolute proprietor, owner, and diſpoſer of this his Creature, Man's Soveraign Lord.

      * Sect. 3. PROP. III. God having made Man a reaſonable Creature, endued with his own Image (as was ſhewed before) not only capable of knowing, but of yielding Obedience to the Will and Law of his Maker, Moral Obedience immediately becomes due, from ſuch a Creature to his Maker.

      * Sect. 4. PROP. IV. Therefore God rules and governs man after another manner, than inanimate things, and brutes, are governed. His Kingdom ruleth over all. Natural Agents are ruled by his power and providence. But man he ruleth alſo a moral Agent, by Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings.

      * Sect. 5. PROP. V. It is evident and undeniable, that ſundry 〈◊〉 Gods Laws (compriſed in that which 〈◊〉 called the Law of Nature) are of Mora• perpetual right, and equity, commandin• what cannot but be mans duty, requirin• ſuch things, as have an unchangeable goodneſs and comlineſs in them. Forbiddin• ſuch things as have an unchangeable horri•neſs and odiouſneſs in them. Some thing are good, and ſome things are evil in thei• own Nature, and therefore are ſo perpetually, invariably, neceſſarily; that it is impoſſible that a righteous and holy God ſhoul• not command the one, and prohibit, an• condemn the other: Such precepts (as ſom• well obſerve) depend on Gods righteou• Nature, rather than on his Soveraign Wil•

      * Sect. 6. PROP. VI. To the unchangeable Law of Nature, God (our Soveraign Lord) may add what Poſitive Laws his Divine Wiſdome judgeth meet, whereby to try his Creatures Obedience. And there is no poſitive precept of His, given to Man, but Man is immediately bound to obey it; even by the Law of Nature, which requires this in general, that we obey God in all things.

      * Sect. 7. PROP. VII. God our ſupreme and abſolute Lord and Governour, to manifeſt his Divine Goodneſs and benignity, together with his Soveraign Authority and Greatneſs, was pleaſe• to his Law, given to Man at firſt, to ad• and annex a gracious promiſe of Future lif• and happineſs.

      * Sect. 8. PROP. VIII. Gods promiſing to man life and happineſs, upon Condition of perfect Obedience [Do this and live] was his part of the Covenant with Adam.

      * Sect. 9. PROP. IX. Innocent Adam as he was bound, ſo he could not but accept of the Terms, or Condition, upon which God propoſed, and promiſed th• perpetuating of his happineſs. And thus Man conſenting to Gods terms, God and Man were formally and actually in Covenant.

      * Sect. 10. PROP. X. Though the agreement and conſent of both th• parties was enough to conſtitute the Covenant; yet for the further ſolemnity an• ratification of it, the Lord was pleaſed t• appoint a viſible ſign or ſigns, as a ſeal annexed to it.

      * Sect. 11. PROP. XI. Being agreed about the thing, there can be no great Reaſon why we ſhould contend much about the Name.

      * Sect. 12. PROP. XII. God by Covenanting with Man, had a further right in him, a new title to his Service, and Obedience. Firſt, he might have commanded man jure creationis, as he was his Creature, had this Covenant never been; Again, he may command him jure foederis, vel foederationis, upon Account of the Covenant betwixt him, and his Creature.

      * Sect. 13. PROP. XIII. As a clear and certain evidence, that God in Covenanting with man, did not lay down his Soveraignty and Authority over him; He annexeth to his Law or Covenant the juſt threatning of a dreadful penalty, Death in caſe of diſobedience. In the day thou eateſt, (ſinneſt) dying thou ſhalt dye.

      * Sect. 14. PROP. XIV. From the fore-going Propoſition (to look no further) it evidently appears, the Covenant betwixt God and Man was not inter pares, ſed impares, not betwixt equals, or perſons equally un-engaged to each other, and ſo that it was not a pure Covenant, but mixed, partaking alſo of the Nature of a Law.

      * Sect. 15. PROP. XV. This Covenant therefore which God made with Man at firſt, was the perfect, Adaequate Rule, both of all which God then required of Man, and of what Man might expect from God. It contained the Rule of Man's Obedience, and the ground of his hopes.

      * Sect. 16. PROP. XVI. In this firſt Covenant there was neither need of, nor place for a Mediator.

      * Sect. 17. PROP. XVII. God was under no tye, or Bond, to make Man immutably holy.

      * Sect. 18. PROP. XVIII. God (as he was not bound to prevent Ma• fall) had holy, wiſe, and good ends permitting him to fall.

      * Sect. 19. PROP. XIX. The Sin of our firſt Parents in eating of the forbidden fruit, how light a matter ſoever it may ſeem to many; yet was indeed exceeding hainous, full of dreadful Aggravations.

      * Sect. 20. PROP. XX. This is the direct and dreadful conſequence, the ſad and woful effect of Man's ſin and breach of Covenant, that thence forward he can lay no claim to the promiſe, but immediately falleth under the curſe and threatning annexed to it.

      * Sect. 21. PROP. XXI. When God threatned man, [that in the day ſinned, or diſobeyed, he ſhould ſurely dy•or dying he ſhould dye,] this will not pro• the full execution of the threatning, 〈◊〉 immediately to attend Man's firſt tra•greſſion; but that Death, and all miſeri• included in it, were immediately due Law.

      * Sect. 22. PROP. XXII. The Penalty threatned in the Covenant works, was neither fully executed (f•• then all Mankind had been utter•• ruined) nor abſolutely remitted (f•• then none were liable to Death a•• Condemnation by that Covenant.) b• relaxed.

      * Sect. 23. PROP. XXIII. •or, Adam's breach of Covenant was not only to his Perſonal prejudice; but ſo miſchievous to all his poſterity, that deſcend from him by Natural Generation, that it ſubjects them all to a ſtate of ſin and wrath.

      * Sect. 24. PROP. XXIV. •e Condition of Man by the Fall, being ſuch as hath been deſcribed, viz. being both under the Guilt, and power of Sin, it is twice impoſſible (as I may ſay) that ever he ſhould be ſaved by himſelf, or by the Covenant of Works, and equally impoſſible, that he ſhould not be caſt, and condemned by this Covenant.

      * Application.

      * Sect. 1. PROP. I. There are but two wayes to be thought of, how Man ſhould come to the enjoyment of God and happineſs; that is, either, 1. By a perfect conformity to the will and Law of God, by unſinning Obedience; Or, 2. Suppoſing Man once guilty of ſin, then in this caſe by pardoning Grace and Mercy.

      * Sect. 2. PROP. II. When the Covenant, by which alone is Salvation, is called the Covenant of Grace, you are to underſtand, it is ſo〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, by way of Eminency.

      * Sect. 3. PROP. III. The Covenant of Grace is ſometimes called, and partakes of the Nature of a Teſtament.

      * Sect. 4. PROP. IV. The Covenant of Grace is ſometimes called 〈◊〉 Law, and hath the force of a Law.

      * Sect. 5. PROP. V. The Covenant of Grace is betwixt God and Man, not betwixt God and Chriſt.

      * Sect. 6. PROP. VI. The Covenant of Grace, having the true Nature of a Covenant, is not without Condition.

      * Sect. 7. PROP. VII. The Condition of the Covenant of Grace is 〈◊〉 performed by God or by Chriſt for us; 〈◊〉 by us; (the Lord enabling us.)

      * Sect. 8. PROP. VIII. Though we are to perform the condition of th• Covenant of Grace, yet we ſhould never perform it of our ſelves, without the help o• ſpecial Grace.

      * Sect. 9. PROP. IX. God hath Promiſed to ſome that Grace, whereby they ſhall perform the Condition of the Covenant.

      * Sect. 10. PROP. X. That Grace whereby the Elect performeth the Condition of the Covenant, was purchaſed by Chriſt for them.

      * Sect. 11. PROP. XI. There is nothing required in the Covenant of Grace, or that the People of God can perform, which can Merit at Gods Hand, but what the Lord promiſeth upon ſuch or ſuch condition, is as much of Grace, as if it were beſtowed without any Condition.

      * Sect. 12. PROP. XII. The Condition of the Covenant of Grace not being required properly to Merit, and purchaſe the Bleſſings promiſed; it follows, that it is only required to make Way, and qualifie us for our Enjoying and partaking of them.

      * Sect. 13. PROP. XIII. The benefits and bleſsings promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, and ſure to all that perform the aforementioned condition, are exceeding great and many, are indeed inexpreſsible, ineſtimable, and inconceivable.

      * Sect. 14. PROP. XIV. The Coventut of Grace is one and the ſame for Subſtance in all Ages. Though it may ſeen to have Varied, yet the Difference is but in Circumſtances, and manner of Adminiſtration.

      * Sect. 15. PROP. XV. There is a two-fold manner of being in Covenant with God, viz. A being only Externally in Covenant, and a being alſo Internally in Covenant with him.

      * Sect. 16. PROP. XVI. They that are only Externally in Covenant, yet are priviledged far above thoſe who are ſtrangers as to the Covenant.

      * Sect. 17. PROP. XVII. Beſides thoſe perſonal Benefits and Advantages accruing to men in Covenant, there is this comfortable priviledge alſo concerning their Seed, that they are involved and taken into Covenant together with the Parents. As this is the Tenour of the Covenant, I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.

      * Sect. 18. PROP. XVIII. They who are alſo Internally in Covenant, are Priviledged far above thoſe, who are only Externally in Covenant.

      * Sect. 19. PROP. XIX. One Special Priviledge of thoſe who are Internally in Covenant with God, is, that they ſhall never totally depart from God, or fall from Grace, or be caſt out of Covenant.

      * Sect. 20. PROP. XX. The Covenant of Grace is the beſt Covenant.

      * Sect. 21. PROP. XXI. The New Covenant of Grace, is the beſt Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace.

    _ OF THE COVENANT OF GRACE.

      * Sect. 1. PROP. I. God the maker of all things, created man a rational being, after his own Image, he being created to know, acknowledge, love, worſhip, obey, and enjoy his Maker.

      * Sect. 2. PROP. II. The Great and Glorious God being Man's Creator, it follows by neceſſary and undeniable conſequence, that he is the abſolute proprietor, owner, and diſpoſer of this his Creature, Man's Soveraign Lord.
