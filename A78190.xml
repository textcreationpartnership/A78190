            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AS in the Apoſtles days, ſome were <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Zealous about the Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they Affirmed;</hi> There are ſome in our days, who have the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant</hi> much in their mouths, while yet they underſtand little of it, yea, are under very <hi>great Miſtakes</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps (Reader) thou wilt wonder to ſee a <hi>New Treatiſe</hi> of this <hi>Subject,</hi> upon which there are ſo many Extant. Yet it were to be wiſhed, that in ſome of them there were not <hi>Multa Corigenda,</hi> foul <hi>Errata</hi>'s. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, let who will Write of it, inſtead of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it a <hi>Finis,</hi> he may conclude with a <hi>Nonnulla Deſiderantur,</hi> there are ſome things yet behind.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Subject is exceeding Copious, and withal, a <hi>neceſſary Subject</hi> to be oft Incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Without ſome knowledge of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Men can neither underſtand God,
<pb facs="tcp:152819:3"/>nor Jeſus Chriſt, nor Themſelves aright.</p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being in Company with a Worthy ſpecial Friend, I was Speaking my Thoughts, <hi>
                  <q>That moſt of the Prevailing Errors of our Times, were from Ignorance of the Covenant of Grace, or not being right in the Doctrine of it:</q>
               </hi> Whereupon he willed me to apply my Thoughts to that Subject. When Conſidering further with my ſelf the dangerous Tendency, and <hi>fad Conſequences</hi> of ſome <hi>Miſtakes</hi> about it, I was ready to ſay <hi>[I alſo will ſhew my Opinion.]</hi> Now to make way for my Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcourſe on the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> it was very Requiſite to Premiſe ſomething of Mans State under the <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Points relating to theſe Two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, I wittingly paſs by, to Inſiſt more larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on what I conceive very Needful at this Day, that might be an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt Prevailing Errors, and a means of Eſtabliſhing Souls in the <hi>preſent Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude before-hand, ſome will account this Diſcourſe a <hi>Dry Piece,</hi> to wit, Such as look only at the <hi>ſtirring of Affections.</hi> But <hi>woful Experience</hi> may Teach us, that it is as well a Chriſtians Duty to ſee to the right <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> of his <hi>Judgment;</hi> for want of which, we have ſeen many ſadly Toſſed to and fro.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152819:3"/>
            <p>The Scripture is <hi>Profitable for Doctrine, 2 Tim. 3.16.</hi> This is one end and uſe it ſerves for. And if the Doctrine herein laid down be Sound, and according to the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> I ſhall hope, it will not be <hi>Unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, I muſt expect, others will be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, and take Diſtaſte, meeting with ſome things here Croſs to the <hi>Opinions,</hi> which they have <hi>Eſpouſed.</hi> Yet I can ſay, the <hi>Diſcovery of Truth</hi> is my Endeavour and Deſign, (and not to <hi>lay open the Nakedneſs</hi> of any of a different Perſwaſion, further than it might ſerve that Way.) And ſure I am, Truth ought to be dearer to us all, than our Credit, or World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concerns.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a Review of the whole, I eſpecially commend to thy ſerious Peruſal, the Twelfth, and Thirteenth Propoſition of the Covenant of Grace, beginning at <hi>Pag. 225.</hi> and ending at <hi>297.</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, wherein every mans <hi>Grand concern</hi> lieth. Reader, if thou haſt a mind to ſee, there I have Indeavoured to ſhew thee the <hi>things that belong unto thy Peace.</hi>

               <p>I Deſign (God aſſiſting) to Diſcourſe of the <hi>two Covenants</hi> betwixt God and Man.
<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> The right opening and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof might help to ſet and keep our <hi>Judgments right</hi> in many points of Divinity, and prevent our falling into many dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152819:6"/>errors. And as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) upon his underſtanding of the point of free Juſtification by <hi>Chriſt's righteouſneſs,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he thought himſelf <hi>apertis portis in ipſum paradiſum intrâſſe,</hi> to have ſtrait way entered into Paradiſe: And <hi>ibi continuò alia mihi facies totius Scripturae apparuit,</hi> forthwith the whole Scripture appeared to him with a <hi>new face;</hi> ſo it would no doubt to many, could they attain to a right and true notion of the <hi>Covenants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have made choice of this Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereupon to ground my Diſcourſe of the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> As this was part of it; part of that firſt Covenant, God was pleaſed to make with Man in innocency.</p>
               <p>I confeſs the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, is more darkly ſpoken of than the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is obvious, becauſe the firſt Covenant was <hi>ſoon broken,</hi> on man's part, that he can claim no priviledge or benefit by it. In this reſpect it is, <hi>as if it had never been.</hi> All man's hope of happineſs depends wholly on that which is called <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>promiſſory</hi> part of that firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not mentioned here, not ſpoken of expreſly: but only <hi>implyed,</hi> and included in the threatning. The Text indeed runneth in the Form of a <hi>Law</hi> with a <hi>threatning.</hi> As we have no more expreſſed here; but,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Precept,</hi> not to eat.—</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sanction</hi> or penalty threatned, death in caſe man did eat, contrary to the charge, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God had given him.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152819:6"/>
               <p>Yet there is more included and implyed here: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Promiſe: A promiſe of the continuance of <hi>Adam</hi>'s life and happineſs, <hi>upon Condition</hi> that he continued his Obedience.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid <hi>[If thou diſobeyeſt thou ſhalt dye.]</hi> it fairly intimates thus much,
<note place="margin">Poena enim denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciata inobedientiae non expectatur, ubi eſt obedientia. <hi>Coccei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſoed.</hi> c. 2. Sect. 24. p. 29.</note> [<hi>If thou wilt be Obedient</hi> in this thing, and whatſoever elſe I command thee, thou ſhalt ſurely live ſtill, and be happy, thou ſhalt <hi>not dye.</hi>]</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Tenor</hi> of the firſt Covenant is included here, that it was [<hi>Do this and live,</hi> diſobey and dye.] That the <hi>Stipulation,</hi> or Condition required of man in the firſt Covenant, was his perfect obedience to the will of God in all things, not only to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> implanted in him, but alſo to any further Command of God's giving Forth.</p>
               <p>As we ſee in this poſitive Law, where the thing forbidden was <hi>lawful in it ſelf,</hi> and only ſinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe forbidden, and forbidden, to prove and try his obedience. As this was indeed <hi>a fit trial</hi> of it, by a Law to reſtrain him from that, whereunto he had a <hi>Natural inclination,</hi> as unto other fruits in Paradiſe (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6.) and which was indifferent, (within <hi>mans liberty</hi> to take and eat) before the giving of that Law.</p>
               <p>But I ſay the Condition of the firſt Covenant was obedience to the will of God <hi>in all things;</hi> therefore it is rightly called the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi> As <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. we read of a <hi>Law of works</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed and oppoſed to the <hi>Law of Faith.</hi> The Tenor of it being <hi>[do this and live]</hi> implyed here in the threatning, If thou diſobeyeſt <hi>in any thing,</hi> be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152819:7"/>it but ſo much as in taſting of this fruit, (which here <hi>to try thy Obedience,</hi> I forbid thee to eat of) Thou ſhalt dye. As <hi>Grotius (de Satiſ.</hi> c. 3.) <hi>per unam Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem peccati omne peccati genus indicatur, ut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primit Lex eadem clarius explicata, Maledictus qui non manſerit in omnibus praeceptis Legis,</hi> Deut. 27.26. Gal. 3.10.</p>
               <p>This [<hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, dying thou ſhalt dye,</hi> meaneth as much as that [<hi>Curſed is he that continueth not obedient</hi> in all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Law of works, the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> was more than <hi>a penal, and praemiant Law,</hi> more than a Law with a promiſe,
<note place="margin">It is true Gods Law with its Sanction may be called his Covenant, before mans conſent, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the matter of it; but it is moſt properly a Covenant when it is conſented unto, having then alſo the form of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> and threatning annexed, that it was alſo a Covenant. I have this to ſay further, <hi>viz.</hi> that we cannot but ſuppoſe, that innocent <hi>Adam</hi> did fully <hi>conſent to,</hi> and readily and thankfully accept of Gods <hi>Terms</hi> and propoſals here [Obey and live, Diſobey and dye.] When God had done ſo much for man in his <hi>Creation,</hi> making him a <hi>reaſonable Creature;</hi> in, or after his <hi>own Image,</hi> able to yield perfect obedience, and when the ſaid obedience was indiſputably, <hi>indiſpenſably</hi> his duty, whether God promiſed ſuch a reward or not, to ſuppoſe now that man was not fully conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Terms offered, (which were moſt juſt and reaſonable) for the continuation of his happineſs, were to ſuppoſe that man was not what he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, (i. e. <hi>reaſonable, and innocent,</hi>) This were to ſuppoſe, that God did not make man upright or perfect, but rather perverſe, and to ſuppoſe that man <hi>lay croſs</hi> to his Maker, even before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152819:7"/>he fell, which is (no doubt) prodigiouſly falſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One thing more included here, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, is, that this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Compact,</hi> was not made with <hi>Adam</hi> alone, but with him, and his poſterity together. Their want of perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods Will and Law, (the thing required, and inſiſted on in the Covenant of works) rendring his poſterity guilty of death, even as if they had ſet their teeth in the forbidden fruit. The <hi>penalty</hi> threatned to <hi>Adam</hi>'s breach of Covenant, we ſee <hi>inflicted</hi> on his poſterity, that certainly they were <hi>involved</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, to be dealt withall upon the ſame Terms. Even Infants, who have not ſinned after <hi>the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> yet through his diſobedience (<hi>mediante cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptione,</hi> their nature by that means being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted) are ſubjected to the ſame death, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Corrinus</hi> takes it thus,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cenſ. Amat. Arm.</hi> c. 9. p. 138.</note> death being threatned unto <hi>Adam that very day</hi> he ſinned, therefore his poſterity could not but partake of his puniſhment. As they muſt all of neceſſity <hi>dye in him,</hi> who were <hi>in his loins.</hi> Yet by his leave, this account he gives of the matter is <hi>utterly ſhort</hi> of that account the holy Scripture giveth of it. The Apoſtle concludeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. That by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, all the world of mankind became <hi>ſubject unto death;</hi> ſo as they are ſubject to it, not only to <hi>dye vertually</hi> in him; but formally to undergoe the Sentence of death in their own perſons.</p>
               <p>Now hence I lay down this Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152819:8"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That God was pleaſed to Covenant with man at firſt, when in the ſtate of innocency, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to give him eternal life, upon <hi>Condition</hi> of his obeying perfectly and conſtantly; withall threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death, if in the leaſt point he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
               <p>And to help your underſtandings, and to lead you on to a clearer conception, and apprehenſion of the Nature of this <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> I ſhall proceed <hi>by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſteps,</hi> laying down ſeveral propoſitions about it: humbly begging the Spirit of truth ſo to <hi>guide</hi> me, that I may not miſlead you here.</p>

It was a fond conceit of <hi>Oſiander,</hi> that man was ſaid to be created after <hi>Gods Image,</hi> becauſe the Son of God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152819:8"/>was to aſſume Man's Nature. But Chriſt was not the expreſs Image of God in this reſpect.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152819:9"/>
                  <p>Now as the <hi>Moral Faculties</hi> (to wit) thoſe which are the proper ſeat of moral Good or Evil) are the chief,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Imago Dei in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe animi facultate proculdubio principem locum obtinuit. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frag.</hi> Britan. de 3 &amp; 4 Art. Theſ. 1. p. 94.</note> And as Moral Good is more Excellent than Natural, and Moral evil worſe than Natural (as Chriſt, was ſubject to a world of evil of this laſt ſort, and yet retained the <hi>Image of God,</hi> moſt fair, and unſpotted, being free from the leaſt touch of <hi>Moral evil:</hi>) Thus the Moral perfection of the faculties of the Soul, is man's higheſt perfection. And herein <hi>chiefly</hi> and <hi>eminently</hi> did God's Image in man conſiſt. And nothing more oppoſite to the Image of God, than <hi>Moral pravity.</hi> As God hath more to doe in Natural Evils, than in Moral. He freely owneth his being the <hi>Author</hi> of Natural Evil, <hi>(is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?)</hi> but it were blaſphemy to make him the <hi>Author of Moral Evil,</hi> or Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Image of God conſiſts not <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> in the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the ſoul: nor only or chiefly in the <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>faculties</hi> of the ſoul (ſuppoſing there were any real diſtinction of the faculties from the Eſſence) which ſome make to be <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> the Glaſs of the Trinity. The Eſſence and Natural powers of the ſoul remain, now that the Image of God is defaced. Nor <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>chiefly</hi> in <hi>dominion</hi> over other Creatures (as ſome would have it) This would rather ſeem to be an Adjunct. (or however a leſs principal part of it) <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Let us make man in our Image—and let them have dominion.</hi> And that it is a thing <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and <hi>ſeparable</hi> too, from the Image of God, from what is principally intended by it, ſeemeth to follow from hence: that both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> are ſaid to have been created in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152819:9"/>Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. They were created both a like in the Image of God: but they were not both <hi>alike in dominion,</hi> the Woman being made for the Man, is ſubject to him. Again, the Angels (ſurely) had the Image of God in as <hi>eminent,</hi> or an higher degree, than Man had; yet were not they made Lords over this lower world, (as man was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6.) that we can any where find. The <hi>Angels</hi> were made after Gods Image, to whom the <hi>dominion</hi> over infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Creatures did not ſo properly belong, as unto men.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Image of God ſeemeth more properly to denote <hi>ſome inward frame</hi> and complexion of ſoul, rather than any ſuch <hi>Eternal priviledge</hi> or prerogative, as Lordſhip over the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we take the <hi>Image of God,</hi> eſpecially and <hi>eminently</hi> to conſiſt in thoſe ſpiritual Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs. That <hi>inward Rectitude</hi> of mans Soul, <hi>God made man upright,</hi> Eccl. 7.29. where (whatſoever <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay) we muſt underſtand, <hi>upright</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rectitude;</hi> (as Moral pravity is oppoſed to it) [finding out many Inventions.] Now what is the Moral <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the <hi>

                  <p>Thus <hi>upright</hi> was man, when he came firſt out of Gods hand, <hi>no errour</hi> in his underſtanding, no irregularity in his will, no <hi>diſorder</hi> in his Affections. A ſign of which we ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. They were <hi>both naked,</hi> the Man and his Wife, and were <hi>not aſhamed.

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:152819:10"/>
                  <p>See what is meant by the <hi>Image of God,</hi> Eph. 4.24. That ye put on the new man, which <hi>after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs:</hi> ſuch as the Saints are by ſpiritual <hi>Renovation,</hi> ſuch was man at firſt by <hi>Creation,</hi> viz. Righteous and Holy; ſo much alſo is hinted in the word [renewed] v. 23. And be <hi>renewed</hi> in the ſpirit of your mind: Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that man had ſuch a <hi>frame of Spirit</hi> once. He was created after God in Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of truth, that Image of God which is in ſome meaſure, <hi>renewed</hi> or reſtored in the Saints; ſee alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. Thoſe ſpiritual endowments, wherein a man <hi>comes neareſt</hi> to God, that it appears God is his <hi>pattern,</hi> (as to be Righteous, Holy. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> ſaith the Lord) theſe muſt needs be moſt properly Gods Image, this is to be made <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or of a God-like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (though Gods Eſſence, and Attributes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable) to have thoſe qualifications, which are the <hi>faireſt repreſentation</hi> of Gods perfections, which can be ſeen and found in any Creature.</p>
                  <p>By the way, what a luſtre is here put upon Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to commend it to us? <hi>Gods Image</hi> principally conſiſts in this; would you be like God? <hi>Be holy, as he is holy.</hi> Though you cannot be <hi>as holy</hi> as he is, with an [as] of equallity; you may, and ought to be <hi>holy</hi> as he is holy, <hi>with an</hi> [as] <hi>of Similitude,</hi> and the more holy, the more God-like. No wonder, that the <hi>Saints</hi> are called the <hi>excellent ones</hi> in the Earth, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.3.</p>
                  <p>But what prodigious wickedneſs is it for any to ſcoff at Holineſs? He that mocketh the poor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth his Maker: How much more he that ſcoffs at purity? What a Diabolical diſpoſition is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152819:10"/>that, which cannot but expreſs an Antipathy, and Indignation againſt Holineſs? ſurely they are very ill affected towards their Prince, that cannot indure to ſee his Picture, but will diſgrace and throw dirt upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Queſtion here is, whether the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>ſupernatural?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here the <hi>Sociniaus</hi> take away the ſubject of the Queſtion, as we underſtand it; They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no more <hi>by the Image of God,</hi> than that <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> man had over the Inferiour Creatures; denying, that <hi>Adam</hi> had any ſuch thing as <hi>Original Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> holding that he was created in a <hi>middle ſtate</hi> without any moral rectitude, or righteouſneſs, which ſhould more encline him to good, than evil. So ſome of the <hi>Popiſh Schoolmen</hi> would have man created, <hi>in paris Naturalibus,</hi> meaning without Grace, Holineſs, or Righteouſneſs; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath determined otherwiſe, God made man <hi>upright.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that Righteouſneſs or uprightneſs concreated with (him, though if we <hi>take an Eſtimate</hi> of it, from what man is now ſince his fall, it is to be called ſupernatural, as being quite above Man's Nature now corrupted, by Sin, and not to be attained to by the <hi>power of Nature,</hi>) Man is reſtored to it only by ſupernatural grace; yet conſidering man in his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate,</hi> as he came firſt out of Gods hand, it was Natural to him; Not as following from his very Nature, Eſſence, or Faculties, <hi>Phyſico modo,</hi> nor as an eſſential part or property of man, naturally conſidered; nor only as perfecting, or adorning Man's Nature, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants it may in this reſpect be termed Natural.

Nay it was <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Moralis Naturae illi debita.</hi> It was a moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment or perfection ſome way due to man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the end for which he was made. Not due <hi>by way of Merit,</hi> but of <hi>condecency,</hi> or congruity to Gods wiſdom and goodneſs (as ſome expreſs it) As the Natural Faculties of underſtanding and will <hi>were due to him,</hi> if God would have any <hi>reaſonable Service</hi> from him. And if God had not conferred on man at firſt this <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> of mind, and will, together with his being (without which man was not <hi>fitted</hi> to acknowledge, ſerve, obey, and honour his Creator) he muſt needs have <hi>miſſed of his End,</hi> for which he made man a <hi>reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and not a <hi>bruit;</hi> ſo this work of his had not been <hi>very good.</hi> The Creation of man little to his praiſe, if he was, made to ſerve God, and not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſufficient abilities to ſerve him. Suppoſe man created at firſt without Original Righteouſneſs, and do you not thereby <hi>impute folly to his Maker?</hi> Is not this to impeach the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God? Yea, how could the Pſalmiſt ſo much <hi>admire</hi> what the Lord had done for man at firſt, making him <hi>a little lower than the Angels,</hi> Pſal. 8.5. when if he was made without true wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he was little <hi>better than the beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſal. 49.20. And let it be conſidered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>want of holineſs</hi> and righteouſneſs in a Creature <hi>capable</hi> thereof, but not ſinful; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether to ſuppoſe man created without the ſame, be not to make God the <hi>Author of Sin.

Adam. ante laps.</hi> Sect. 22. p. 195. <hi>vide etiam</hi> Sect 21. So let it be conſidered, whether to deny that man at firſt had <hi>Original righteouſneſs,</hi> be not to ſuppoſe Natural concupiſcence (which is now in every one contrary thereto) to be <hi>from God and Nature,</hi> underſtand pure Nature) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good in it ſelf, not ſinful, carnal, inordinate, concupiſcence, or that propenſion in men to things forbidden is <hi>natural</hi> indeed, ſpeaking of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it is corrupted by the Fall; yet it was not natural ſpeaking of Man's Nature, as it was at firſt before he fell. Though as he had a body, he was inclined <hi>to things of ſenſe,</hi> yet the <hi>Senſitive appetite</hi> was in perfect ſubjection to the <hi>higher powers</hi> of his Soul had he attended to hold the ſame in ſubjection. It was his Sin to ſuffer the <hi>ſenſitive appetite</hi> to rebell and rule in him. But had there been any ſuch thing as <hi>inordinate, concupiſcence</hi> or Rebellion of the ſenſitive appetite againſt reaſon, in Man's <hi>pure Nature</hi> as it came from God, this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there would be a neceſſity of holding with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that the Motions of the ſame were not Sin, any more than hunger and thirſt; otherwiſe we ſhould make God the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, attend to this Argument, to prove that <hi>Adam</hi> was created with <hi>Original Righteouſneſs.</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> was created righteous, or unrighteous, or in a midle ſtate betwixt righteous &amp; unrighteous, one of theſe you muſt hold. But certainly he was not created unrighteous; for that were again to make God <hi>the Author of Sin.</hi> That would be to ſay, God made man unrighteous, contrary to plain Scripture,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152819:13"/>and to the <hi>common ſentence</hi> of all that are right in their <hi>ſenſes,</hi> neither could he be in a <hi>ſtate of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> betwixt righteous and unrighteous; becauſe man a reaſonable creature <hi>was bound</hi> to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as ſoon as ever he had a being. And the leaſt <hi>deflection</hi> in this Nature from the Rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be unrighteouſneſs in him. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive that man ſhould be <hi>in medio negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> here, neither righteous, nor unrighteous. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we ſuppoſe man ſet in ſuch a ſtate by God, ſtill this foul and <hi>horrid conſequence</hi> would follow, that God was no more the cauſe of Man's holineſs and happineſs had he ſtood, than of his ſin and miſery, when he fell: That he ſhould no more have <hi>owned any praiſe</hi> and thanks to his Maker, had he choſen and perſiſted in the way of righteouſneſs; than he can <hi>juſtly charge</hi> God with his ſin and perdition.</p>
                  <p>But thus I hope it ſufficiently appears, that <hi>Adam</hi> had Original Righteouſneſs <hi>concreated</hi> with him, and connatural to him. This Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was then <hi>Natural,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural.</hi> It was not above the Condition of Man's Nature then, but <hi>requiſite</hi> for the <hi>ſtate,</hi> wherein he was, and <hi>the end</hi> for which he was made. Again, this Original righteouſneſs in <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>Natural</hi> in another reſpect, as oppoſed to what is <hi>meerly perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> (as Original Corruption is Natural.) It ſhould have ben <hi>derived</hi> and conveyed with his Nature to his Poſterity; had he kept it. Holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is not Natural to the Saints, that have God's Image in ſome meaſure reſtored. It is <hi>ſupernatural</hi> to us now, that we cannot convey it to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But it was <hi>Natural</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> at firſt, and and ſo, that had he not loſt it, it ſhould have been <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:152819:13"/>to his poſterity, as now the Corruption of his Nature is propagated.</p>
                  <p>Ah! How is man <hi>changed</hi> from what he was at firſt? How are we <hi>ſunk in our kind?</hi> Man was <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> at firſt, but now miſerably depraved, he that was <hi>little lower than the Angels by</hi> Creation, by his own degeneration is become <hi>like the beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> Of all our loſſes the loſs of Gods Image; this, this is the greateſt. A loſs ever to be lamented. The <hi>Crown is fallen from our heads, woe unto us, that we have ſinned.</hi>

<note place="margin">Mar. of Mod. Div. p. 154.</note> That Believers are not concerned with, nor obliged by the Law of God, as delivered by <hi>God Creator,</hi> but only as delivered and confirmed <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> or God in Chriſt, our Redeemer; That they are no more to look, at the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as in the hands of <hi>God-Creator,</hi> or as in the hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but only as in the <hi>hands of Chriſt,</hi> to receive the ten Commandments <hi>only,</hi> as they are the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot but look upon ſuch Doctrine as very dangerous, tending to ſubvert the <hi>very foundation</hi> of true Piety and Religion. I take that to be very ſound <hi>(Aſſemb. Confeſ. of Faith,</hi> c. 19. Sect. 5.) <q>The Moral Law doth for ever bind all, as well juſtified perſons, as others, to the obedience thereof; and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but alſo of the Authority of God the Creator, who gave it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I grant, we are to receive the Law not only as delivered by the Creator, or as delivered by him immediately without a Redeemer; neither are we to receive it from Chriſt, the Redeemer only, as excluding the Authority of the Creator.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:152819:15"/>
                  <p>True it is, <q>We are under no Law here, but what is the Law of Chriſt, as being <hi>(jure Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis)</hi> the Univerſal King. (As Learned Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi> The Law of Chriſt is, Firſt, The Law of Nature-redeemed in his hand. Secondly, His pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſuper-added remedying Law. The former is now part of the precepts of Chriſt, and bindeth us to perfection, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti;</hi> though not <hi>medii,</hi>
                     </q> in regard of the pardoning promiſe. Yet this does not take away all Authority from God, as if the Law was quite taken out of the Creator's hand, when it was put into the hand of Chriſt. We read <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi> And yet in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Father judgeth without reſpect of perſons, according to every mans work.</hi> Though he judgeth not <hi>executively,</hi> ſo as Chriſt does, who ſhall pronounce the Sentence in an audible manner; yet he judgeth <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> in, and with, and by Chriſt. The Father is not ſtripped of his right, and Authority of judging, by committing judgment to the Son. That is not the meaning of <hi>[The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man:]</hi> but that he judgeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone without the Son, but with, and by the Son; ſo though the Law be in the <hi>hand of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> yet it is not thereby quite taken out of the <hi>Creators hand;</hi> It is not the Son only, that rules and governs by his Love; but the Father in, and by him. And let it be conſidered, whether the damned are not ſo <hi>under the Law of God-Creator,</hi> that all their hatred of God, and blaſphemy againſt him, is ſin? And when Chriſt ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to the Father, whether the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall not be <hi>under the Law of God Creator?</hi> ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152819:15"/>that if they ſhould not continue to obey perfectly, they ſhould ſin. And whether never till men come into the other world, they come under this Law of their Creator, or were they not under it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
                  <p>That the Law of God as Creator ſhould not oblige all men, as they are his Creatures, is a wonderful ſtrange <hi>Paradox</hi> to me. If Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>as they are his Commands,</hi> do not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and determine Man's duty, and lay a neceſſary tye upon man to Obedience, then God hath <hi>loſt his Authority</hi> over man (this is plain) or man is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the <hi>condition</hi> of a creature. But do not the holy Angels <hi>obey the Commands</hi> of God, as the Commands of their Creator <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 103.20.) and ſhall we think man is <hi>exempted</hi> from Obedience in that reſpect? Has man a priviledge here above the Angels in Heaven? And what will be their duty to Eternity, to love, praiſe, ſerve, and worſhip God, and obſerve his pleaſure, <hi>as being their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> can this be a ſin, and weakneſs in believers; we read <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father:</hi> But they that hold the Law of God binded them, not as it is <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but only as it is the Law of Chriſt, would ſeem to honour him, <hi>not as the Father, but above</hi> the Father. And of whom doth the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy:</hi> Is it not the ſame <hi>with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now grant this, that the Laws and Commands of God are immediately conſtitutive of mans duty, or Obligatory, even <hi>becauſe, or as they are</hi> the Laws and Commands of God, (and grant this you muſt, or you quite overthrow <hi>the courſe of Nature,</hi> utterly confound the <hi>order of beings,</hi> make the creature independant, and <hi>ſui juris,</hi> Lord of it ſelf, you deny Gods Dominion and <hi>Authority,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by race the foundation of all Religion, and cannot glorifie him, as God, but rather deny him to be God.)

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152819:17"/>they are Creatures,</hi> and this is the ſtanding Law of their Creator, though it is alſo further binding to us, as confirmed by Chriſt, and in the hand of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus that diſtinction of a Threefold Law, <hi>viz. [The Law of Works, the Law of Faith, and the Law of Chriſt,]</hi> as he explains, and applyes it, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very <hi>weak</hi> and unprofitable; yea, unſafe; though he layes ſo great ſtreſs upon it, as to tell us, <q>That ſo far forth as any man <hi>comes ſhort</hi> of the true knowledge of this threefold Law, ſo far he comes ſhort both of the <hi>true knowledge</hi> of God, and of himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, 1. One would think, that the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> (to ſpeak properly) ſhould be the <hi>Law of Chriſt;</hi> yet he diſtinguiſhes between the Law of Faith, and the Law of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth betwixt the <hi>Law of Works</hi> and of <hi>Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. but never betwixt the Law <hi>of Faith,</hi> and the Law <hi>of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I think the common diſtinction <hi>of a Covenant of works,</hi> and <hi>of Grace;</hi> or as others expreſs it, The old <hi>original Law,</hi> and the new <hi>Remedying Law,</hi> much clearer, and to better purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His oppoſing the <hi>Moral Law, as in the hand of God-Creator</hi> to the ſame Law as in <hi>the hand of Christ,</hi> and holding that believers are only bound by the Law, <hi>as delivered by Chriſt,</hi> is intollerable. It is granted, that we are not under the Law, only as delivered by the Creator, not under the Law of Nature, as meerly created, or as given at firſt to man in innocency, but he oppoſeth thoſe as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which ought to be conjoyned. As if we could not be bound by the Law, both as it is the Law of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152819:17"/>our Creator, and as it is the Law of our Redeemer; but are free from it in the former reſpect, if bound in the latter: This ſeems intollerable. For ſo it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Believers are not <hi>redeemed unto God</hi> by his blood (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.) but rather <hi>redeemed from him,</hi> not to owe that ſubjection to him, which they did before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That through the redemption of Chriſt, they are advanced <hi>above the Condition</hi> of Creatures. For by the Law of Creation, as <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are bound to obey the Law of their Creator. But certainly Chriſtians in being redeemed by Chriſt, do not <hi>ceaſe to be creatures.</hi> I ſay you do not ceaſe to be creatures, when you become Chriſtians, nor does God <hi>loſe the Right</hi> he had in you before, to require Obedience from you; but he hath now a further right in you. The old Obligation by your creation is not taken off, but ſtill in force, when this new Obligation, by your Redemption is further added, and lay'd on you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. According to what this writer layes down, it is the priviledge of believers, not to have any after Sins pardoned, and remitted as <hi>to the guilt of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment;</hi> but only as to the prevention, or removal of ſome temporal chaſtiſements. They are under no Law, but the Law of Chriſt; and Chriſt's Law threatens no other penalty than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſement.

                     <hi>that till his Sin be pardoned, he is liable to be condemned for it.</hi> So the matter is brought to this Iſſue, that for the Sins which a man commits after he believes, he hath no need of pardon, nor can be (with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) pray for the pardon of his ſins, not only in that <hi>more famous</hi> ſence, that we uſe the word [pardon] in: But even in the <hi>loweſt</hi> ſence, wherein the word is ever uſed. He hath no need of pardon <hi>to free him from Condemnation,</hi> becauſe no ſin can make him <hi>liable to Condemnation.</hi> Again, he hath no need of pardon, to <hi>free</hi> him from <hi>Temporal chaſtiſements;</hi> becauſe it is not threatned, but <hi>when there is need</hi> for it; and when there is need for it, a <hi>ſanctified croſs</hi> hath more of mercy in it, than an <hi>unſanctified Comfort,</hi> where a perſon is not by any Law liable to any puniſhment, ſuch a perſon (ſure) has no need of pardon.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould think that believers as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are bound to obey God in all things, and that Chriſt came not to take off the obligation to duty and obedience, but to take off the obligation to wrath and puniſhment. That their ſins are properly ſins, as againſt Gods Law, and deſerve puniſhment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hell in their own Nature, as well as the Sins of others. Only they have this relief by the new Covenaant, they ſhall not be condemned for them.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the third Propopoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> Man being a reaſonable Creature, he oweth Moral Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Maker. Now it follows.</p>

                  <p>And here again I cannot but enter my diſſent, and declare my diſlike of what that writer, with whom I had to do before, layes down ſo confidently, that a true believer is to obey;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Marrow</hi> p. 209.</note> yea, does obey, <hi>without fear of Hell, or hope of Heaven.</hi> And ſo far forth as they eſchew evil,

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall not ſay much here concerning the fear of puniſhment, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of that afterwards.</p>
                  <p>And to prevent miſunderſtanding, I ſhall lay this down, That a true believer does not obey God <hi>meerly</hi> out of ſuch ſelf-reſpect, as for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hope of reward. No, he hath a true <hi>love to God,</hi> and a love to the <hi>Law of God.</hi> As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as he hath a love to God, and obeyeth in love, ſo he hath, and ought to have a love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too. And although gracious Souls in ſome holy raptures, have the Love of God ſo far prevailing in them ſometimes, that for the preſent they would ſeem quite to forget themſelves, and to <hi>ſet aſide all reſpect</hi> to their own Souls, as it was with holy <hi>Paul</hi> there, where (had it been poſſible) he could have wiſhed himſelf <hi>accurſed from Chriſt—</hi> Rom. 9. Yet it is not thus with them ordinarily, neither yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152819:19"/>may we ſay, that ſo far as Chriſtians look, and aim at their own happineſs, ſo far they <hi>degenerate</hi> and act like <hi>Slaves,</hi> not like themſelves. <hi>All love</hi> of the reward is not a <hi>mercenary love:</hi> but when men only reſpect the reward. Now a Child of God hath <hi>a love to his work,</hi> as well as to his <hi>reward,</hi> Gods commands are not grievous to him; but indeed this is grievous to him, that he is no more conformed to Gods commands. And were it put to ſuch an ones choice, he would not deſire any liberty to tranſgreſs them, but would have more power to keep them. But what a groſs miſtake is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are not <hi>only</hi> to obey for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>only</hi> in hope of reward, to conclude thus, therefore they are not at all to regard either what God hath threatned, or promiſed.</p>
                  <p>And if it were ſo, that men were not to obey with any reſpect to what God hath promiſed them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How great a part of Scripture is given to us in vain, but all Scripture is profitable—to make the Man of God <hi>perfect,</hi> and to perfect the Godly man, that he may be <hi>thorowly furniſhed</hi> to every good work. Shall we think that God hath made ſo many <hi>promiſes in vain.</hi> That thoſe great and <hi>precious</hi> promiſes in Scripture are but <hi>Cyphers,</hi> and ſtand for nothing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is it not <hi>horrible pride</hi> for men to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more perfect than innocent <hi>Adam</hi> was, to conceit that they yield obedience unto God upon more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> grounds and <hi>motives?</hi> This is evident, that the Law given to innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> was backed with a threatning, and a promiſe. And ſo it was his duty both to dread the threatning, and to have regard unto Gods promiſe.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Mutual Engagement</hi> of parties, is all that is eſſential to a Covenant. This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Promiſe, and a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Promiſe</hi> is that which bindeth one party <hi>ſingly;</hi> A <hi>Covenant</hi> is that wherein both parties are <hi>mutually</hi> bound.</p>
                  <p>To the Covenant betwixt God and Man, it was no way neceſſary, that Man ſhould <hi>indent</hi> with God, or make his own Terms; No, he was bound to <hi>accept</hi> of ſuch <hi>Terms</hi> as it ſhould pleaſe his Lord and Maker to ſet down, and offer; whatſoever God required of him, would bind him immediately, <hi>as a Law,</hi> without his conſent, or liking of it. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152819:28"/>before Man could have the liberty of making his own Terms with God, he muſt <hi>firſt ſatisfie</hi> and take off that <hi>Obligation</hi> on him, as a Creature to obey <hi>his Creator in all things,</hi> which Obligation a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can no way poſſibly take off, or be freed from, while he is a Creature.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the Covenant betwixt God and Man, God is to <hi>propoſe</hi> the Terms, and Man is obliged to accept of them, as propoſed by Him.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Covenant, the Covenant of Works, where the <hi>Condition</hi> was <hi>perfect Obedience;</hi> the Lord required no more, than what was due from Man, though God had not promiſed any further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thereupon.</p>

It contained the Rule of Man's</hi> Obedience, <hi>and the ground of his hopes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Stipulation or condition required, was no leſs than the <hi>whole duty</hi> of Man, obedience to the will of God in all things.</p>
                  <p>The promiſe of life (belonging to this Covenant) included in it <hi>all good,</hi> agreeable to Man's preſent ſtate, and everlaſting happineſs, at the end of Man's probation-ſtate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>death threatned</hi> upon Man's diſobedience, we ſee explained in part, what it was in thoſe evils, which ſin hath brought upon the world of Mankind, <hi>manifold miſeries,</hi> in this life we feel; we all naturally fear, and look for temporal death, <hi>(The living know that they ſhall dye.)</hi> And which is inconceivably more, ſin ſubjected to all <hi>miſerie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Spiritual, and Eternal.</p>
                  <p>Thus the firſt Covenant determined both of Man's <hi>duty,</hi> and of his <hi>Condition,</hi> as to felicity, or miſery, as to life or death, according as he performed, on failed in his duty. If he was Obedient in all things, then he was ſure of life and happineſs, if he failed in any the leaſt point of <hi>Obedience required,</hi> then he

                  <p>But whether the threatning of the firſt Covenant did properly belong to it, as a Covenant, or a Law, I leave to others to determine.</p>

                  <p>Thus you ſee to what iſſue the matter is brought, if we ſhould deny the old Law <hi>in force,</hi> as threatning death to every ſin, <hi>ſcil.</hi> conſequently we deny that there can be ſuch a thing as pardon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the promiſſory part of the Covenant of works, or Law of Innocency, that cannot be ſaid to be <hi>abrogated,</hi> but only <hi>ceaſeth, ceſſante capacitate ſubditi,</hi> ſince the fall Man is no capable ſubject. For a Man to be a ſinner, and yet to be capable of claiming life and happineſs by the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> is indeed a plain contradiction. Such a Law, or Covenant, when once the condition becomes <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible</hi> (as learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſomewhere noteth) <hi>tranſit in Sententiam,</hi> it ceaſeth to promiſe in this caſe, and inſtead of that, <hi>paſſeth Sentence</hi> upon men. Yet cannot ſinners blame God, that righteouſneſs and life come not this way, as if the failure was in his promiſe.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſinners) ſhould ever attain to the condition of the Covenant of works, which is <hi>full conformity</hi> and perfect Obedience to Gods will, therefore that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is indeed <hi>ceaſed</hi> as to us.</p>
                  <p>But to think that Man's ſin could abrogate the Covenant, that God had made, is very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As if a man could ſatisfie and <hi>diſcharge</hi> a Bond by <hi>forfeiture.</hi> As if a ſubject by breaking the Law, could make himſelf <hi>lawleſs.</hi> He may thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152819:44"/>himſelf of the benefit &amp; <hi>protection</hi> of the Law, it's true, but cannot exempt himſelf <hi>from the Duty of Subjection</hi> to it. Again, to think that God would abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it, and take Man's failing in his duty, as a ground of excuſing him from his duty, is as unreaſonable. Then might one not have ſaid, <hi>Noli ergo imperare,</hi> now give up the Government of the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, to think that Chriſt would give himſelf, and improve his intereſt for the abrogation of it, would be an unworthy reflection on him. As if in his office and undertaking, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> he had not carried <hi>equally,</hi> indifferently conſulting the Intereſts <hi>of both parties,</hi> with the like real tenderneſs. As if he had not been as true to his <hi>Father's honour,</hi> in preſerving his right in, and authority over his creatures, as to his <hi>peoples ſafety;</hi> but did too partially incline to us, though the <hi>offending party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was enough for the <hi>ſecuring</hi> of the ſalvation, and happineſs of his redeemed ones, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a <hi>new Law of Grace</hi> written in his own blood, <hi>[That all that believe in him ſhould be juſtified, and ſaved,]</hi> notwithſtanding the old Original Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in force.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I tell you Chriſtians, this does advance and ſet forth the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God, and exalt the praiſe and merits of your Redeemer; that <hi>for his ſake,</hi> your ſincere, though weak, imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is accepted, from whom yet <hi>perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is is as due to God, as from any; and that for his ſake your ſins are pardoned, which are <hi>as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſins,</hi> and as truly deſerve hell and wrath as the ſins of any.</p>
                  <p>Thus I ſay, there is no reaſon to think, the <hi>firſt Original Law</hi> is made void by the after remediant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152819:45"/>Law. For both may ſtand in force together; as that ſtrict Law given to the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for <hi>putting Tranſgreſſors to death;</hi> to which was ſuperadded this Law of Grace, that in ſuch and ſuch caſes the Law-giver, the Rector did admit of a <hi>Commutation,</hi> that upon offering a Beaſt in Sacrifice, the Tranſgreſſor's life ſhould be ſpared <hi>(though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by the Law)</hi> Lev. 5.17, 18. So this Original Law, whoſoever ſtands indebted to another, ſhall ſatisfie his Creditor, or be liable to <hi>an arreſt,</hi> and to be caſt into Priſon, remains in force; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſuppoſe ſuch a <hi>relieving Law</hi> as this made afterwards, That if any perſon in Debt, ſhall ſerve in the Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> while they are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the publick, they ſhall be <hi>protected</hi> from any arreſt. Theſe inſtances may help to clear the Queſtion I am upon, eſpecially the former.</p>
                  <p>Many think, that becauſe the Law of works ſerves not to the ſame <hi>uſe and end,</hi> for which it was given to Man in the ſtate of Integrity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be <hi>abrogated,</hi> that we are no more obliged by it. Not conſidering that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why righteouſneſs and life cannot come by the Law, is not any <hi>weakneſs in the Law,</hi> but our weakneſs and incapacity to fulfil it. The Law of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> indeed cannot juſtifie, becauſe of <hi>its weakneſs. (For it is not poſſible, that the blood of Bulls and Goats, ſhould take away ſins,</hi> Heb. 10.4.) But the <hi>Law of righteouſneſs,</hi> which I am ſpeaking of, were it not for Man's weakneſs, would juſtifie. Therefore that we cannot be juſtifyed by the Law of works now, let us not lay the fault on the Law, but on our ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:152819:45"/>
                  <p>Truely, I cannot but wonder at ſome, that would have this a Queſtion <hi>of great difficulty,</hi> but of little moment whether the Law of works, given to <hi>Adam,</hi> continue in force to all Mankind; methinks it is of very <hi>great moment,</hi> ſo that if we ſuppoſe the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it, we give the Antinomian no little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And methinks it is very plain, that it muſt continue to bind Man (obedience to God in all things being no more than he is <hi>for ever obliged</hi> to, as he is a creature) though for non-performance of ſuch obedience as that Law requires, God is not <hi>bound</hi> to Man by that Law.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore the Law of works is ſtill in force, that none of us can ſay, If we obey God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, we <hi>pay him all we owe,</hi> he requires no more; we cannot ſay that our ſins do not <hi>legally deſerve</hi> Eternal death; but only that though the Law of God looks upon us as ſinners, <hi>and condemns our ſins,</hi> as well as the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet this we may plead againſt the <hi>Execution</hi> of the ſentence, and <hi>condemnation</hi> of the Law. There is alſo <hi>a new Law of Grace,</hi> an Act of General <hi>Indempnity</hi> and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion which Chriſt hath procured, which God hath <hi>paſſed,</hi> that frees us from the curſe and penalty of our ſins, <hi>if we repent, believe, obey</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>i.e.</hi> if we lay hold on the Grace offered to us, with an unfeigned deſire and reſolution to live and be, as this Grace that bringeth Salvation teacheth us.</p>

The ſenſitive appetite, (which was the lower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, inferior to the will, and underſtanding, and <hi>to be ruled</hi>) came to rule in Man, the other powers loving and liking to have it ſo. Thus the <hi>neareſt end</hi> of the loweſt faculty (as things of ſence) the things of the fleſh, the having and enjoying of thoſe things, became the laſt and <hi>higheſt end</hi> of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior faculties. What horrible confuſion was here brought into Man's Nature by ſin? That if you look upon him in a <hi>Moral conſideration,</hi> he was no longer ſuch a Creature as God made him, but quite another thing; though he had the ſame <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> faculties after his fall as before, yet the <hi>moral qualities</hi> of thoſe faculties were not the ſame, but directly contrary. God made <hi>man upright,</hi> with an appetite in perfect ſubjection to right reaſon, with a clear underſtanding of the <hi>chiefeſt good,</hi> with a will ſweetly cloſing with that good; but when through inadvertency (as I ſaid before) he fell from God to a <hi>falſe good,</hi> all theſe faculties were immediately corrupted, and depraved, the rectitude of them quite loſt.</p>
                  <p>If any one ſhould ſay here, but as <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell, turned <hi>from God</hi> to the Creature, and to a falſe good; might he not of himſelf turn from that falſe good unto God again?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But may not the Scripture mean, we are made ſinners by <hi>imitation</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> rather than by the propagation of corruption from him? May we not underſtand it thus, that we are corrupted by his evil Example?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, That were not to interpret but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Scripture. That which is <hi>born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi> Does not this ſpeak plainly of Natural Generation, and nothing of <hi>imitation.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in Sin did my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152819:52"/>Mother conceive me.</hi> Certainly, <hi>David</hi> is here confeſſing <hi>his own ſin.</hi> Not the ſin of his Parents, but that which he had cauſe to be aſhamed of, and humbled for, as <hi>his own Sin,</hi> not anothers. So that Text <hi>[by the Diſobedience of one many were made ſinful]</hi> If it meant by <hi>imitation</hi> only, then it ſhould have been ſaid, that we were made ſinful by the Serpent, by Satan, or by the Woman, <hi>Eve,</hi> rather than by <hi>Adam;</hi> or why is the ſpeech limited to the diſobedience <hi>of one,</hi> when the world is full of pernicious examples; great multitudes there are, that draw others to ſin by their <hi>evil Examples.</hi> And multitudes that are drawn to ſin this way, who never read or heard of <hi>Adam.</hi> And thoſe that have heard of <hi>his ſin,</hi> have alſo heard of his <hi>puniſhment;</hi> that ſhould rather deterre them from ſin. And plain experience ſhews, that not his particular example, which is ſo <hi>remote;</hi> but nearer examples have the moſt malignant influence upon men. And that Children in the moſt <hi>religious</hi> families, where are the beſt precepts, and examples both, do bewray <hi>corruption of Nature,</hi> as ſoon as ever they can put forth any Acts of reaſon. Oh what <hi>ſtrangers</hi> are they in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea, ſtrangers in the world, yea, ſtrangers to their own hearts, that ſee not the <hi>firſt riſe</hi> of ſin and wickedneſs that is in the world ſince the Fall, to be from an <hi>evil inclination</hi> within men, and not from an obſervation and imitation of others. And I know not well, what can be replyed to that, if we are made ſinful by the diſobedience of one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> only by <hi>imitation,</hi> then may we not be ſaid (by a parity of reaſon) to be made righteous by the Faith of one <hi>Abraham,</hi> we walking in the ſteps of his Faith?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:152819:52"/>3. The next thing I would clear to you is, That this Natural inherent pravity, or Original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>ſinful.</hi> It makes us really guilty before God, obnoxious to his wrath and curſe for ever. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely wave ſpeaking of the <hi>guilt of</hi> Adam<hi>'s firſt tranſgreſſion,</hi> the imputation of it to his poſterity immediately, and antecedently, or <hi>irreſpectively</hi> to this corruption of Nature, propagated from him, leaving it to the ſober conſideration and diſcuſſion of the Godly-learned.</p>
                  <p>But though we hold <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin propagated, <hi>Non peccatum perſonae, ſed peccatum Naturae;</hi> not his perſonal ſin, not the tranſient action; but the ſin of the Nature of Man, the corrupting of his Nature; for ſo it was an inherent, permanent, <hi>Evil quality:</hi> this alone ſufficeth to condemn any one in the world. In regard of this inherent pravity and corruption, which is in every one from his <hi>very birth,</hi> yea, from his very quickning in the womb; we all deſerve death and condemnation, deſerve to be <hi>dealt withal</hi> and puniſhed, after the ſame manner, as if we had done what our firſt Parents did.</p>
                  <p>Now this is very plain and evident from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and were <hi>by Nature Children of wrath,</hi> even as others. Nothing but ſin could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us to Gods wrath, to which yet we are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious by <hi>Nature,</hi> one as well as another. And if obnoxious to Gods wrath by Nature, then <hi>ſinful</hi> by Nature. So that there is ſin and guilt in our very Nature, before ever we come to the practice and commiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, what an undeniable proof is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by Sin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men,</hi>

                  </gap> giving Sentence with me, beyond the <hi>merits of the cauſe,</hi> and ſtrength of the proof you ſhall ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Touching what hath been delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> (that firſt Covenant God made with Man) this is the ſum, <hi>viz.</hi> That God having made Man, had a right to rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him; and might only have enforced his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with threatning of ſevereſt penalties. Yet to ſhew forth his infinite Goodneſs, as well as his Soveraign Greatneſs, to his Laws he annexed a <hi>free and large promiſe</hi> of endleſs life and happineſs. Now Man being created a reaſonable and innocent creature, could not but <hi>conſent to the terms</hi> God propounded. Thus God promiſed life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Man <hi>upon condition</hi> of perfect obedience, and Man engaged to obey God in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> notwithſtanding ſoon tranſgreſſed God's Command, violated his Covenant, utterly diſabled himſelf from performing that obedience the firſt Covenant required, and ſo deprived himſelf of all <hi>right and title</hi> to that happineſs there promiſed.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152819:60"/>Laſtly, <hi>Adam,</hi> being the root of Mankind, and having by his ſinful fall corrupted his Nature, and begetting Children <hi>like himſelf,</hi> unclean, fleſhly, corrupt, and guilty before God, it became utterly impoſſible that any of his poſterity ſhould attain to happineſs by the Covenant of Works. Thus in diſcourſing of the Covenant of Works I have ſhewed you.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What was Man's eſtate by Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> holy and happy.</item>
                  <item>2. What it was by the Fall, <hi>viz.</hi> Sinful and miſerable.</item>
                  <item>Now 3. I am coming to ſhew, what it may be by Grace, in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This is declared and made known in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Thus the Covenant of Grace is our laſt and <hi>beſt refuge.</hi> It is like a plank after a Shipwrack, or like a <hi>fair haven</hi> in a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>Sinners, who are expoſed to all wo and wrath by the breach of the Covenant of Works, may find ſhelter; yet in and under the Covenant of Grace. Sinners, whom a <hi>deluge</hi> of miſeries doth threaten to overwhelm, may yet be ſafe and happy, getting into this <hi>Ark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel holds forth a pardon to ſinners ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced and condemned by the Law. If we look into the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> there we ſhall only ſee matter of terrour and ground of deſpair: but coming to the Covenant of Grace, here we may find opened <hi>a Door of hope.</hi> Hither muſt we come, here muſt we reſt, as ever we would be happy, of which we ſhould every one ſay as holy <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>This is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</hi>

Though I cannot but ſee ſad diſorders both in my ſelf and others, both at home and abroad, yet his Covenant is <hi>well ordered</hi> in all things. Though I am ſubject to change, though my outward condition be oft changing, though I be at great <hi>uncertainty</hi> in reſpect of any worldly proſperity; yet God's Covenant with me that is ſure, and there are <hi>ſure mercies (Iſa.</hi> 55.3.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.

                  <p>Now here I might propound this Queſtion, to be conſider'd, whether the <hi>promiſe of the firſt ſubjective diſcriminating Grace,</hi> or of working of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. belong to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or as a <hi>Teſtament.</hi> It ſeems not to be formally included in the conditional Covenant of grace, nor properly to belong to it as ſuch, but rather as a Teſtament; but of that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs one of great note, ſtraineth this term too far. Making a <hi>Teſtament</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> oppoſites in this reſpect, that a Covenant hath conditions, but a Teſtament is an Inſtrument of meer bounty, <hi>citra ullam conditionem,</hi> without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152819:65"/>New Teſtament; that by means of Death—they which <hi>[are called]</hi> might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance. This Text which ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely of the New Teſtament, doth not exclude, but include a condition. Who are they that receive the Eternal inheritance, bequeathed in Chriſt's Will and Teſtament? They that <hi>are called,</hi> ſayes the Text; where doubtleſs we are to underſtand effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, <hi>ſo called,</hi> as that they come into Chriſt upon the Goſpel-call.</p>
                  <p>And upon this account I ſhould not reſtrain the conſideration of it, as a Teſtament to the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> before cited, ſeems to do.)

For thus they are fairly agreed, <hi>Moſes enim loquitur de pacto, ſed non quovis, niſi dandae haereditatis—Paulus vero de teſtamento, non quovis, ſed conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato, quod eo ipſo eſt pactum: Ergo ſine ulla impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietate à pacto ad teſtamentum tranſivit Paulus in hac materia, quia ſimul utriuſ<expan>

                  <p>At preſent take notice only, that when the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is called a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the reaſon is not, becauſe it is <hi>abſolute,</hi> unconditional; for ſo it is not; but becauſe it is firm, <hi>unalterable.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed now by the Teſtator's death.

                     <q>It is a Covenant without all condition required in the creature, but what God himſelf performeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though I freely grant no man <hi>would perform</hi> the condition of the Covenant of Grace, without ſpecial grace and help from God; yet to ſay, It is without <hi>all condition,</hi> but what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf performeth, is a raſh, unſound aſſertion. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſelf-<hi>contradiction.</hi> It is to ſay the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is abſolute, and not abſolute; without all condition, and not without all condition required in the creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is indeed <hi>blaſphemous</hi> to ſay that God doth believe in us, repent in us, obey in us. He giveth the grace &amp; <hi>ability,</hi> but it is man that <hi>performeth</hi> the <hi>Act.</hi> He giveth his people that <hi>ſpecial help,</hi> whereby they come to believe, repent, obey. But it is one thing for God to enable us to perform the condition, and another to perform it himſelf. It is below the <hi>Majeſty of God</hi> to perform the condition for us; as it is <hi>above us,</hi> quite above our ſtrength, to perform it without him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If there be no condition required in the creature, but what God <hi>performeth,</hi> then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhould run thus, I the Lord do promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and ſalvation unto you, <hi>upon this condition</hi> that I give you an heart to believe and repent, upon condition that I <hi>perform</hi> this in, and for you.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thus men ſhould not deſerve to ſuffer for <hi>non-performance</hi> of the condition; it being that

                  <p>To adviſe ſouls that doubt of their <hi>Goſpel ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to ſee <hi>it in Chriſt</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> does) to ſee it in Chriſt, who hath obeyed perfectly, is miſerably to confound the conditions of the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> which ought to be moſt carefully diſtinguiſhed. And it implieth thus much, as if ſuch were troubled about what doth not at all <hi>concern</hi> them. Why ſhould any trouble themſelves about the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, to find it in themſelves, if Chriſt hath <hi>performed</hi> the ſame for them? As if ſouls ſhould diſquiet themſelves, that they cannot ſee how they can ſatisfie <hi>Gods juſtice</hi> for their ſins, when Chriſt hath done that, and it is not expected from them. If Chriſt hath performed the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace for us, then it belongeth not to us to perform it.

                  <p>And if Chriſt fulfilled the conditions of <hi>both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi> for us, then it followeth, that even as he made us without us, ſo he <hi>ſaveth us without us;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.

                  <p>And if we muſt hold, that God giveth to all men that are alike in their carriage, like grace, <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> not to one more, to another leſs; then how can I pray or hope, that he ſhould do that for me, which he will not do for every one in the world, of the like condition and capacity with me?

                  <p>Other things I paſs by, being ſpoken to before.</p>
                  <p>Now this Propoſition, that Chriſt is the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of Grace, may be of good uſe. As</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) This ſpeaks encouragement to poor deſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſouls, who have a deep ſenſe both of their own <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>unworthineſs.</hi> Though thou art ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unworthy of Grace, yet Jeſus <hi>Chriſt is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> for whoſe ſake it may be freely Imparted to thee. Grant, that thou art unworthy, that he ſhould own thee; yet ſurely he hath deſerved to have a people in the world, that ſhould own him indeed, believe on him and ſubmit to him. He is <hi>worthy</hi> to have a people to ſerve and Honour him. And he hath taught us to pray, <hi>[Thy Kingdom come,]</hi> though we are unworthy to be Tranſlated into his Kingdom. He is worthy to be our Ruler, though we are <hi>unworthy</hi> to be acknowledged by him, as his Loyal Subjects. He that hath Fought for us, Died for us, is worthy to be <hi>our Head,</hi> though we are unworthy to be his Members. Well, here is Encouragement for ſuch as begin to <hi>enquire after</hi> him, only they fear, they ſhould have no part in him, ſear that they ſhall be rejected of him: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if thou canſt not be <hi>ſatisfied without</hi> Chriſt and his Grace, it is a ſign, the Lord hath begun with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152819:113"/>thee, to bring thee over to himſelf. It is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thou art part of Chriſts purchaſe, which he will not loſe. Converts are the Travel of his ſoul. And he is abundantly <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> to ſee this Fruit of his ſorrows. When ſouls become willing to bow to his Scepter. It is the <hi>day of Chriſts</hi> Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. It is the day of Chriſts <hi>glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> and Triumph; it is as a <hi>Coronation day</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. The day of the gladneſs of his Heart. Let the thoughts of thy former unworthy carriage and diſpoſition be <hi>humble,</hi> but not <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> thee. Remember, that he hath received Giſts for men, yea, for the Rebellious alſo, that the Lord God may dwell among them. He hath <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi> many a rebellious Creature by his Grace, and made them Loyal Subjects. And if now thou art lamenting after him, it is to be hoped, he is at work with thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But they are ſo <hi>very few in compariſon,</hi> that ever attain to an Intereſt in Chriſt, and ſaving Grace, that I know not how to hope, it ſhould be ever ſo well with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they were never ſo few, yet while there are any, and ſo long as the thing is poſſible, thou art to ſeek it above all things in the world: And if thou muſt die and periſh, yet thou ſhouldſt reſolve to die and <hi>periſh in purſuit</hi> after Chriſt, and Grace.

Doth he promiſe, that <hi>[If the wicked turn from his wickedneſs, and walk in Gods Statutes, he ſhall ſurely live;]</hi> his ſins ſhall not be mentioned unto him, (as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16.) And will any deny this to be a <hi>gracious promiſe,</hi> becauſe conditional? Is it not plain, that what the Lord calleth for here, is of Right, and a <hi>due Debt</hi> from us? But that he promiſeth to <hi>receive</hi> ſinners opon <hi>their return;</hi> this is not of Debt, but of Gods abundant Mercy, and Free-grace.</p>
                  <p>And how ſhould he <hi>in Honour go lower</hi> than he doth, or <hi>in Faithfulneſs to the Intereſt</hi> of the ſouls of his people?</p>
                  <p>Theſe three things therefore make up the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Repentance</hi> towards God, without this no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Salvation: <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh.</hi> But on the contrary, <hi>If the wicked turn,</hi> he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>If ye believe not, ye ſhall dye in your ſins, Joh.</hi> 8.24. But, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 16.31.</p>

                  <p>Under theſe three, (Repentance, Faith, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience) is included whatſoever the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace requireth, and where one of theſe is, there are the other. They are <hi>inſeparable:</hi> and where one is named, the other are underſtood.

                  <p>Under the old Teſtament the condition of the Covenant of Grace is ordinarily expreſſed by <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, (Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Seeking him (Amos</hi> 5.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17.) <hi>walking uprightly, (Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>keeping his commandments, (Pſal.</hi> 103.18.)</p>

                  <p>I am not ignorant, how ſome have argued, an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit knowledge</hi> and belief of Chriſts death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, not to have been abſolutely neceſſary to the ſalvation of thoſe, that lived <hi>before Chriſts coming</hi>

                  <p>And yet methinks, it is plain, that the faithfull, that lived and died before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, as they <hi>had ſome means</hi> of attaining to the knowledge of a Redeemer, ſo they had ſome <hi>knowledge of a Redeemer,</hi> though it was <hi>more general</hi> and confuſed, not ſo clear and diſtinct, as what Chriſtians now have: But the doctrine of <hi>mans Redemption</hi> was preached to <hi>Adam</hi> immediatly after his fall <hi>[The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head]</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> could ſpeak of his Redeemer, <hi>Iob</hi> 29.25, 26, 27. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth.</hi> And faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chriſt teſtifieth of him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152819:122"/>Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day: and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> And <hi>Iacob</hi> invocates the <hi>Angel of the Covenant, Gen.</hi> 48.15, 16.

This Angel was <hi>his Redeemer,</hi> (And ſo the Meſſiah is called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20.) Again, the ſame Patriarch, when he lay a dying, breaks forth into this ſweet note, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>I have waited for thy ſalvation, O Lord:</hi> which the two <hi>Chaldee Pharaphraſts</hi> explain thus, (as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> noteth) <q>our father <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not the <hi>ſalvation of Gideon ſon of Ioaſh,</hi> which is a temporal ſalvation; nor the <hi>ſalvation of Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſon of <hi>Manoah,</hi> but the <hi>ſalvation of Chriſt</hi> the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> who ſhall come to bring to himſelf the ſons of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe ſalvation my ſoul deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</q> The Patriarks that <hi>dyed in the faith,</hi> ſaw ſomething in the promiſe, which they did not live to ſee fulfilled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.

                  <p>Now if you attend to this; that all grace is <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> or virtually in that <hi>ſeed of God,</hi> you will know what to ſay to thoſe nice queſtions, whether faith or repentance be firſt? And whether we are <hi>firſt united</hi> to Chriſt by; and then receive ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces from him? It quite cutteth off ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe. As that faith, which <hi>uniteth unto</hi> Chriſt, ſuppoſeth the underſtanding enlightned, and the will ſet right; that is, the ſoul <hi>renewed.</hi> So that queſtion, whether faith be ſeated in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the will? would appear to be an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent queſtion. As many Philoſophers of late can ſee no reaſon to ſuppoſe thoſe faculties <hi>really diſtinct</hi> from the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, this may eaſe your minds of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that the <hi>ſeeming difference</hi> among ſober Divines, about the condition of the Covenant, may occaſion. Take notice of this I pray; they that make faith the <hi>onely condition,</hi> yet are far from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that faith goes alone; No, it hath the whole <hi>train of graces</hi> attending on it. The new heart, that which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth, a divine, or <hi>Godlike Nature,</hi> hath them all.</p>
                  <p>Another ſound Divine I meet with,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bulkley of Covenant, p.</hi> 334. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> makes faith <hi>the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Covenant of grace,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152819:130"/>but there he takes Faith in ſo <hi>large a ſence,</hi> as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>ſincere Obedience.</hi> And ſo he telleth us, when God ſaith in the Covenant <hi>[I will be your God,]</hi> the meaning is not only, that he will be a <hi>God of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to us, to pardon and bleſs us; but a God <hi>over us,</hi> to <hi>Rule and Govern us:</hi> And that Faith cloſeth with him in <hi>both reſpects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He grants, <q>The Covenant betwixt God and us, is, like that between a King and his People. Faith ſets God upon <hi>the Throne,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Reign thou over me.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, <q>If he do at all make a Covenant with us, he will be a <hi>God to us,</hi> as well <hi>to Rule</hi> us, as <hi>to ſave us;</hi> to ſay, Live as ye will, yet you ſhall be ſaved, is the <hi>Devils covenant,</hi> not Gods.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I would not take ſuch for Adverſaries, who agree <hi>in the thing,</hi> only they differ in words, in the manner of expreſſing themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Faith indeed is the only Receptive condition. As in its own Nature it is an Accepting or Receiving of Chriſt offered in the Goſpel, in which reſpect it is choſen and appointed by God, and is the great Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary condition of the Goſpel: But then beſides Faith, (the Receptive condition) there are other Diſpoſitive conditions, which are either neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied, and included in Faith, or are neceſſary Attendants on it. For which ſee what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or All-ſufficient <hi>God, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Or be <hi>ſincere, upright.</hi> Or [be thou perfect] though thou art not <hi>already perfect,</hi> yet be preſſing on towards Perfection. As it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Note of Sincerity and Uprightneſs, to <hi>ſtrive after Perfection.</hi> And no leſs is required of us,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152819:130"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Having therefore theſe Promiſes, (wha Promiſes? Thoſe <hi>Covenant promiſes</hi> mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18.) let us cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs, and be <hi>perfecting Holineſs,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the fear of God. Though we are not perfect in Holineſs, while here, yet we muſt be <hi>perfecting Holineſs:</hi> This is required of all Gods Covenant People. And who are they that deal not falſly in his Covenant, but ſuch as <hi>walk uprightly,</hi> whoſe hearts depart not from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18. Who are they that <hi>keep his Covenant,</hi> but ſuch as give themſelves to keep his Teſtimonies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. Keep them, as <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. As <hi>David,</hi> who deſired to have a <hi>reſpect to all</hi> Gods Commands, would lay all Gods Judgments before them: Though they cannot yield <hi>ſinleſs Obedience</hi> to any one Command, yet their deſire is to Obey all Gods Commands. They Obey his Laws <hi>Impartially,</hi> though but <hi>Imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Pſal. 15.1, 2. <hi>Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy holy Hill?</hi> VVho ſhall go to Heaven?

                  <p>And what can be more plain, than that this is <hi>part of the condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace; even from thoſe very Texts. which may plead and urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all conditions.

And as ever you would <hi>enjoy the Bleſſings therein</hi> promiſed, as ever you would have the pardon of ſin, and an Intereſt in God, and Eternal happineſs, you muſt come up to theſe Tearms: And be <hi>it known unto you all,</hi> that if you do not like well of theſe Tearms, you may <hi>ſtick to the Covenant</hi> of Works, and from thence receive your Doom: But certainly, you cannot <hi>claim any part</hi> in that Happineſs, held forth in the Covenant of Grace.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152819:131"/>Offenders, who had a purpoſe to Tranſgreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to go on in ſin? would not this be an <hi>embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening</hi> of ſinners?

Would it not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaithfulneſs to God and to your ſouls, did we ſhun to <hi>declare all the</hi> Counſel of God concerning you? Well, I muſt tell you what you are every one of you to truſt to, God hath <hi>Sworn by his Holineſs,</hi> and he will not Lye, he will never alter this thing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152819:132"/>that is gone out of his Lips; he hath given you <hi>Propoſitions of peace</hi> in writing, you have the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Covenant, ſigned with his own Hand; <hi>Sealed in the Blood</hi> of his Son: You have heard the Contents what it is that the Lord requireth of you. Now what ſay you? Are not his <hi>Ways equal?</hi> Are not the Tearms very fair? Are not his Offers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gracious? If you are not pleaſed with them, you may <hi>take your courſe;</hi> yet I muſt ſay, refuſe them at your peril. As I muſt warn you, and in the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> I warn you this day, that you never look that he ſhould offer Mercy to you upon other Tearms than theſe. I call Heaven and Earth to record againſt you this day, that you have had Life and Death ſet before you, and I <hi>warn you</hi> every one, that you do not preſume of any part in Chriſt or Salvation purchaſed by him; or that any of the <hi>ſaving Benefits,</hi> and Bleſſings held forth in the Covenant of Grace, are yours, if you are not indeed ſenſible of the evil of ſin, and <hi>truly humbled</hi> for ſin if you do not truly renounce your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and really reſolve to forſake all known ſin, to practiſe all known Duty, to walk before God, and be upright.</p>
                  <p>How is it poſſible, that they ſhould be <hi>true to their League</hi> with God, faithful in his Covenant, who yet continue in League with any Luſt, any known ſin, Gods <hi>declared enemie;</hi> and who refuſe to come under any known Law of his?</p>
                  <p>Know this, that as a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> righteouſneſs cannot, ſo neither can an <hi>Antinomian faith</hi> ſave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> would tell the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines of his dayes, that the Devil had a faith as well as they. Indeed Libertines have another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152819:132"/>not the <hi>true Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt. Therefore they muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeds have another faith, not the true Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Some would perſwade themſelves, and others too, that Chriſt hath done all: That they muſt <hi>ſee their Repentance in Chriſt,</hi> and Goſpel-obedience in Chriſt, which is a very ſhort cut to Heaven. But how <hi>ſmooth and ſpecious</hi> ſoever this Doctrine may ſeem to ſome, yet it is moſt falſe, corrupt, and dangerous Doctrine. Chriſt never ſatisfied for our full and final breach of the Covenant of Grace, though he did for our breach of the Covenant of VVorks. Not but that ſins <hi>againſt the Goſpel</hi> are pardoned for the ſake of Chriſt. Not but that Chriſt ſatisfied for ſins againſt the preceptive part of the Goſpel, and Non-performance of the condition for a time; but theſe are pardoned to none, but thoſe that come to perform the Goſpel condition, that is, Believe and Repent in time.</p>
                  <p>Shew me one Text, that will prove, there was ever any ſinner in the world, pardoned and <hi>ſaved in a ſtate of impenitency</hi> and diſobedience. Chriſt hath told us, what is the portion of Hypocrites and Unbelievers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. And if any of you continue ſuch, there you may read <hi>your Doom.</hi> Look what ſentence he gives forth now in his word, he will not contradict, but fully ratifie in the laſt and great day.</p>
                  <p>And ſee what he ſaith, Mat. 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And Luke 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not, that I ſhould Reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Such as reject Chriſt now, will find ſuch welcome to him another day, that they ſhall be rejected of him. [If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you, ſhall I be your Head?] Chriſt will not be <hi>our Saviour</hi> upon other tearms.

                  <p>Again, is it <hi>not good</hi> that the heart be humbled for ſin, broken for ſin, the more to looſen it from Sin, and to engage it the more againſt ſin for time to come?

                  <p>As there is a twofold call, ſo there is a twofold relation to God; as a twofold manner of being in Covenant with God, ſo a <hi>twofold interest</hi> in Him. Obſerve it, there is a common, external, and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; and again there is a ſpecial, internal, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual call to God: So there is a more <hi>common</hi> Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, and a more <hi>ſpecial</hi> Relation to Him. A Common intreſt in God, and a Special intreſt in him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed a great priviledge it is to be a people <hi>near unto the Lord,</hi> to be ſo much as externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Him. Yea, it is far better to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Houſe and Family, though under the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Rod, than to be driven out of his houſe and heritage, though it were with <hi>Babylon,</hi> to fit as Queen in the earth. Better to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, to enjoy his word and ordinances, the ordinary means of ſalvation; than
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:152819:138"/>to enjoy the largeſt ſhare of worldly Pleaſures, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Proſperity, without them. Thus <hi>Englands</hi> Mercies (were the Land more Impoveriſhed than it is, yet) are to be prized above the Treaſures of both <hi>Indies.</hi> That was a deſperate prophane ſpeech of him, that ſaid, <q>He would not change his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for a part in Paradiſe.</q> The Barreneſt part of <hi>Gods Hill,</hi> is to be choſen before the <hi>fateſt Valleys,</hi> where God dwelleth not. So <hi>Lot</hi> found: Surely, they have cauſe to ſay, The Lines are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to them in pleaſant places, and they have a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heritage, that dwell in <hi>Emmanuel's Land.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are the People, that hear, and know the joyful ſound: The Damned, with whom God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley no more, count ſuch happy. The <hi>Heathen,</hi> that are <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and ſtrangers to the Tearms and Tenor of his Covenant, did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their own Eſtates, would count ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But as it is the Miſery of thoſe <hi>without,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, not to know their Miſery; ſo of too many <hi>within the Church,</hi> not to know, or conſider their own happineſs, what Advantages they have for Heaven above others. As our Saviour, weeping over that ſinful City, that rejected him and his Grace; that choſe rather to Die and Periſh, than to be gathered under his healing Wings: [O, if <hi>Thou hadſt known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace,</hi> Luke 19.42.] If thou hadſt known theſe things, then mighteſt thou have been for ever happy.</p>
                  <p>But therefore thou that haſt attended to the things of thy peace, and haſt come in upon Gods Call, thou art happy: Now is Salvation come to thy ſoul. And if there be enough in God, in Chriſt,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:152819:139"/>in Heaven to make thee happy, thou ſhalt be for ever happy. Others have had Life and Salvation <hi>offered,</hi> but could not ſee to take it. But happy thou indeed, who haſt (with <hi>Mary) choſen that good part,</hi> which ſhall never be taken from thee. To thee this everlaſting Covenant (which I am opening) ſhall be a ſpring of Everlaſting Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now you may look upon God, as your God indeed. I ſay, <hi>God is yours.</hi> And though this be a <hi>ſhort Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> ſoon uttered, yet is it ſo Copious a Subject, as you might be Meditating on all your days, and yet never be able fully to comprehend the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs included in it. When I ſay, <hi>God is yours,</hi> I have ſaid all, I can ſay no more: For all Happineſs is implied, and included in it.</p>
                  <p>The miſery of the Damned is comprized in two particulars, <hi>ſcil. In poenâ Damni,</hi> and <hi>In poenâ Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> in what good they have loſt, and are deprived of for ever, and what evil they feel, have Inflicted on them, and muſt ever lie under. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the happineſs of the Faithful is ſum'd up in theſe two Points, to wit, <hi>Freedom from Evil,</hi> and <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good.</hi> And how ſafe are they, who have God for their <hi>Shield?</hi> How Rich are they, who have God for their <hi>Portion,</hi> an All-ſufficient God for their Reward? O exceeding great Reward! As holy <hi>David</hi> ſays here, <hi>This is all my Salvation, and all my deſire:</hi> Or as ſome read it, <hi>He is all my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and He is all my deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">[1.] That now you have a ſpecial propriety in God, this is all your Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) It ſpeaks you <hi>freed from the guilt of ſin.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. Where the Lord promiſeth to be

Now what a bleſſed Priviledge is this, to have your ſins pardoned! Even as <hi>David deſcribeth Bleſſedneſs,</hi> Pſal. 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> What would not a condemned Traitor, or Malefactor give for the Kings pardon? And what is a Pardon from God worth then, which could no other way be Purchaſed, but by the moſt precious Blood of his dear Son? But you who have felt what a burden ſin is, and have ſometimes cried out of that burden, as Intollerable; certainly, you cannot but account the pardon of ſin a Mercy and Priviledge ineſtimable. O bleſſed change indeed, for one that was a Rebel, ſentenced to Death by the law of Heaven, to have the black Sentence rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to become a Favourite of God: For a Child of Wrath to become a Child of Love. The pardon of ſin carrieth <hi>Redemption</hi> in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption (through his Blood) even the Forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> The pardon of ſin connotes, <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or is all one with it. The way of Juſtifying one that hath been a ſinner, an Offender, being by the pardoning of all, wherein he hath offended. The pardon of ſin ſpeaketh peace, and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. God was in Chriſt Reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin inferreth <hi>Adoption, Gal.</hi> 4.5.</p>

                  <p n="5">(5.) It ſpeaketh Exemption, or <hi>Deliverance from outward Troubles,</hi> when it may be good for you.

Though earthly Friends may fail, may forſake you; yet here is a Friend indeed, that will ſtick to you, and abide with you for ever.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) The good <hi>Providence</hi> of God is ſtill at work for you. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.17. Gods attributes are ſtill at work for you. <hi>His Eyes</hi> at work. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Eyes of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy. The Eyes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152819:147"/>of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole Earth, to watch over thoſe, whoſe hearts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right towards him, His <hi>Hands</hi> are at work: The good Hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him; yea, many times his <hi>Arm</hi> is made bare, his Arm is ſtretched out. That the Heathen, and their Enemies are forced to acknowledge, The Lord <hi>hath done great things</hi> for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, What hath God wrought?</hi> Who raiſed up the Righteous man from the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> O how great is his goodneſs, which he hath <hi>laid up</hi> for them that fear him, and which he is alſo <hi>laying out</hi> on them, which he hath wrought for them before the ſons of men!</p>
                  <p>The Providence of God is two-fold, there is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Povidence, and a ſpecial Providence.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Common Providence</hi> over the Creatures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as they are Gods Creatures. A <hi>Special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> over the Faithful, as in nearer Relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, his Children, his Friends, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. As God hath a <hi>Special propriety</hi> in them, ſo he hath a ſpecial care of them.</p>
                  <p>We read he preſerveth Man and Beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. But more <hi>eſpecially</hi> that he preſerveth the Faithful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23. He is the Saviour of all men, but <hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> of them that Believe.</p>
                  <p>Yet even the Common Providence of God is a ſpecial ground of Encouragement to his People, That he is the <hi>Preſerver</hi> of all things. If he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth for the young Lyons, and the Ravens that cry; much more that he will provide for the Sheep of his Paſture, and for his Lambs; while he Feeds his Enemies, he will not let his own Children ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>Again, That he Governeth all things, without whom no man can lift up Hand or Foot in all the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:152819:148"/>world, without whom not a Dog that can move his Tongue. He that ruleth in <hi>Jacob,</hi> over-ruleth all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ends of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But come we to his <hi>Special Providence</hi> over the Faithful. So, <hi>all the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth unto ſuch as keep his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. By the <hi>Paths of the Lord,</hi> there we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not the Paths <hi>of his Precepts,</hi> wherein he would have us to walk, but the paths of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> wherein he walks towards his people: The way of his proceedings.</p>
                  <p>And what is ſaid of theſe paths? They are al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>[Mercy and Truth]</hi> which ſome make an <hi>Hendig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> like that Jer. 22.3. <hi>Execut Iudgment and Righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, Execute righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So here Mercy and Truth, <hi>i. e. Mercy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Or we may take them as diſtinct, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thus much, that God doth not only <hi>begin</hi> with them in a way of mercy, but <hi>goes on</hi> with them as he had begun. His mercy to ſuch is conſtant. He continues his loving Kindneſs to theſe, even <hi>of his truth</hi> and Faithfulneſs; or thus, Truth hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome word that God hath ſpoken: Not to the <hi>word of threatning</hi> here, becauſe Mercy is joyned with it: What can it refer to therefore, but the word <hi>of Promiſe?</hi> ſignifying Gods performing promiſe, keeping Covenant with ſuch as keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him? So the meaning is, in <hi>all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages</hi> of Divine providence God is ſtill intending good, and extending Mercy, and performing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his people.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Patience</hi> may be exerciſed towards others; but his ſpecial Grace and Favour, his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tender Mercy is drawn out towards you.</p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:152819:148"/>
                  <p>God may ſhew <hi>ſome Mercy</hi> to wicked men, in ſome of his ways. But alas, their Mercies are not <hi>pure Mercies,</hi> No, there is wrath alſo mixed with their Mercies. As the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had Quails and a Curſe. But you have <hi>real Mercies,</hi> a bleſſing with Eſtate, a bleſſing with Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods ſpecial Love with Common Mercies, greatly Enhaunſing and Raiſing <hi>the Value</hi> of them. They come not as <hi>Wind-falls</hi> of common Providence (as <hi>one expreſſeth it</hi>) but are ſound Fruits, growing on the Promiſe. So there is Mercy <hi>in all</hi> Gods Paths towards you. You ſhall meet with it at every turn, Mercy ſhall prevent you, and follow you, and compaſs you about. Yea, in the end you ſhall <hi>find Mercy</hi> in the croſſeſt Paths of Providence, wherein at preſent you may apprehend nothing but <hi>Severity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, whatſoever Mercy God ſheweth to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet they have no aſſurance thereof. How ſoon may Gods <hi>Patience</hi> be turned into Fury, and his Goodneſs into Severity? But God hath promiſed that he will not turn away from you, (<hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40.) to do you good. But you who have a care to walk before God in <hi>ſincerity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> you ſhall find all his ways Mercy and Truth. And this leads me to another Priviledge of yours.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) The <hi>Promiſes</hi> are yours, exceeding great and precious Promiſes. You are the Children, and Heirs of <hi>the Promiſe.</hi> Promiſes are held forth to others; but they are alſo made <hi>over to</hi> you. To the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſome ſence pertained the Covenants, and the Promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. God had written thoſe <hi>great things</hi> to them, and offered thoſe great things to them, yet they not looking after the Condition
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:152819:149"/>required of them, it was <hi>in effect</hi> as if God had made no ſuch promiſe. But you that can plead the <hi>Condition</hi> is <hi>performed,</hi> nothing can bar your right to the Promiſe? God will never plead a <hi>[Non eſt factum]</hi> againſt thoſe who may plead the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is performed. As the Lord ſaid to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the Land of Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eaſtward, and Weſtward: For all the Land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it.</hi> So I may ſay to you concerning the <hi>word of the Kingdom</hi> (as the Goſpel is called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.) The word of Promiſe, look it through from the beginning to the end, <hi>ſearch this good land</hi> that floweth with Milk and Honey, a Land of Brooks of Waters, of Fountains, of Depths, that ſpring out of the <hi>Rock Chriſt;</hi> where are both the Upper Springs, and the Neather Springs, Promiſes concerning this Life, and the Life to come; a Land of Vines, and Fig-trees, and Pomgranates; <hi>Dig into its Mines,</hi> full of hid Treaſure, more precious than Gold that periſheth, all is your own. The whole Land is before you, this <hi>Goſhen,</hi> this Paradiſe, is given you, till you come to be Tranſlated to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Your <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſends you theſe pleaſant, and precious Fruits, to revive and chear your ſpirits, till you come to a <hi>fulneſs of joy</hi> in his preſence, come to the ſight and Fruition of Chriſt in Glory. <hi>Look up to Heaven,</hi> are you able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Stars of Heaven? Neither can you take the juſt ſum of what the Lord hath promiſed you; They are called <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. Here are deep Mines, deep Myſteries, who ſhall lead us into <hi>theſe hid treaſures,</hi> unknown to the VVorld?
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:152819:149"/>What need of the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enlighten our minds, that <hi>we may know</hi> what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of his glorious Grace?</p>
                  <p>O precious Promiſes indeed! promiſes of <hi>more Grace.</hi> To him that hath more ſhall be given, and he ſhall have in abundance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29. God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more Grace to the humble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of perſeverance in Grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>John</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are Promiſes <hi>made to Grace,</hi> of which I could eaſily recite many: But after one hath uſed his utmoſt skill to open theſe Treaſures, and to give you an Account, how much is contained in them, he muſt end with [an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] After all, he muſt acknowledge there is much more behind undiſcovered, like that Path (<hi>Job</hi> 28.7.) which the <hi>Vultures</hi> eye hath not ſeen, as may allude to the Expreſſion. It is quite beyond our <hi>Arithmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> to find out the Total of the Divine Promiſes. So its impoſſible that any true Believer ſhould know <hi>how rich</hi> he is in the Promiſes. O! the Promiſes are a long Field indeed, and much <hi>hid Treaſure</hi> in this Field; yea, an unknown Treaſure.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> are yours, <hi>eſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> for you, and bleſſed unto you.

                  <p>Well, you that have a ſpecial Intereſt in God, have a <hi>ſpecial right</hi> to the Ordinances of God; and may expect a <hi>ſpecial bleſſing</hi> on them, may look to enjoy God in them: Or if the Lord ſhould ſee good to <hi>cut you ſhort</hi> of Sanctuary-priviledges; yet you

                  <p>And is not this a Crediting of the Goſpel? And ſhould it not confirm our Faith in the Goſpel?

Even the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was 430. years before the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> (as the Apoſtle urgeth againſt thoſe, who were ready to adhere to the Law <hi>in oppoſition</hi> to the Goſpel.)

                  <p>O how ſhould we <hi>reverence</hi> the Goſpel! how ſhould this advance the Grace of God in our thoughts! It is the <hi>antient Goſpel,</hi> the everlaſting Goſpel, like the everlaſting Hills; even from the beginning, God ſet forth this way of Salvation.

                  <p>But there is an Objection againſt this Argument from Circumciſion, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Every man that is circumciſed, is a <hi>Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> And conſequently, circumciſion ſhould rather have reference to a Covenant of Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a miſtake, to confound the <hi>Law</hi> (of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh) with the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> or covenant made with man <hi>in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi> The Law to which Circumciſion bound men, was the written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which though it is ſometimes called the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> yet is really diſtinct from the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works</hi> made with man at firſt.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. The <hi>Law is not of Faith: But the man that Doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> (as <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5.) Which as it had reference
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:152819:164"/>to the Law in <hi>the Political ſence,</hi> is to be underſtood of a long and proſperous life upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>Further, as the falſe Apoſtles and carnal <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Juſtification, and Salvation, upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Obſervation of the Law, as if Circumciſion, and other works of the Law were highly Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 32. and 10.3.) Thus it was to them a <hi>ſuppoſed Law, or Covenant of Works.</hi> Not that God did ſo intend it, but they did ſo miſapprehend it. Not that Circumciſion did indeed bind men to the ſtrict Terms of the <hi>proper Covenant of Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of Circumciſion, in the <hi>ſence of the falſe Apoſtles,</hi> and as they abuſed it. They urged it as neceſſary to Juſtification, as <hi>a work of the Law,</hi> ſetting <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt Chriſt: And would have it ſtill practiſed, when by Chriſt it was <hi>aboliſhed.</hi> Againſt theſe, the Apoſtle argues, if you will keep up circumciſion ſtill, by the ſame reaſon, you muſt <hi>keep up all Iewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> and obſerve the whole <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, to which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did oblige them.</p>
                  <p>But obſerve it, the uſe of Circumciſion as inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, was not to bind them to Legally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and <hi>ſinleſs Obedience;</hi> nor did <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any faithful <hi>Jew</hi> ſo underſtand it. So indeed it would have been no priviledge at all;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.</note> ſo it would have been no happineſs or <hi>advantage,</hi> but a miſery; and terror for them to have been taken into Covenant with God by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. But though compared with the more <hi>eaſie Inſtitutions</hi> of the Goſpel, circumciſion was a Yoke, binding them to that <hi>more burdenſome</hi> way of Service, which God at that time had appointed; yet comparing their eſtate then, with that <hi>of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:152819:164"/>Heathen,</hi> circumciſion was an Honourable Badge of them, whom God owned as his <hi>peculiar people.</hi> And though as Circumciſion had relation to their political Law, it bound them to the ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe Statutes, <hi>Judgments and Ordinances,</hi> which God had given them in <hi>ſpecial:</hi> Yet as it had relation to the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, which was ſtill on <hi>foot,</hi> it only bound them to ſerve and obey God in ſincerity and truth, in what he then revealed to be his Will; and ſo much is (no doubt) required of every one in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. Again,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That covenant which holds forth Salvation to Fallen man, cannot be the covenant of works, but the covenant of Grace. But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> held forth Salvation to them, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews:</hi> So it was while they were in covenant. And upon this account the land of <hi>Judah</hi> might be called Emphatically, <hi>The Land of the Living.</hi> Theirs was the Land of the Living, and the Valley of Viſion: Whereas other People fat in Darkneſs, and <hi>in the Region and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152819:165"/>hope they had of future Happineſs, it depended, or was built <hi>and bottomed on the Covenant,</hi> then on foot.

                  <p>Now if Salvation was of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as is already proved) it undeniably follows, that <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> was made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as with us Chriſtians. Surely, none that conſider what they ſay, will dare to affirm that they might have Salvation, though <hi>under a Covenant of Works,</hi> and not of Grace.

Thoſe words ſpoken to <hi>Moſes</hi> [I am the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>] prove them not only <hi>in being ſtill,</hi> but in a <hi>ſtate of happineſs.</hi> And ſo the Import of the Phraſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Covenant, which had the Spirit and Grace of God attending the Adminiſtration of it,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152819:166"/>was undoubtedly a Covenant of Grace. But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> had the <hi>Spirit and Grace of God</hi> ſo attending it. The Spirit was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and Exhibited then, though not in ſo large a meaſure, as under the Goſpel, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>to the word that I covenanted with you,</hi> when ye came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo my <hi>Spirit remaineth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. Is the Spirit of the Lord ſtreightned? Are theſe his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? <hi>Thoſe high Encomia</hi> given to the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart: The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes,</hi> agree to it only, as <hi>the Spirit doth accompany</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>There was the ſame Spirit of Faith given out under the Old Teſtament, though not the <hi>ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith.</hi> And it was a Prayer, which a Saint under the Old Teſtament put up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy Spirit is good: Lead me</hi> (i. e. by thy Spirit) <hi>into the Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi> And there was the <hi>ſame Love</hi> to God, to his Word and Worſhip, to his Saints and Servants in the faithful of Old, as is in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, under the Goſpel. And they obeyed from the ſame <hi>gracious Principle,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Jewiſh Sacraments did repreſent <hi>and ſignifie the ſame thing,</hi> as Goſpel-Sacraments do; from whence it would ſeem to follow, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with them is for <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> the ſame with that which Chriſtians are under. Methinks it is plain, that the Apoſtle makes Circumciſion and Baptiſm, the ſame in ſignification, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. They did all eat the <hi>ſame ſpiritual
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:152819:166"/>Meat,</hi> and they did all drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink: For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock, that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt. Would any one imagine, that Chriſt ſhould be held forth Repreſented, or Typified, in <hi>Sacraments</hi> relating to the <hi>Covenant of Works?</hi> That their Sacraments did Typifie Chriſt to come, and ours do ſet him forth as already come; will not prove two Covenants <hi>Eſſentially different,</hi> but only two different Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of the Covenant. As it will not prove <hi>two Chriſts,</hi> one that was then to come, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is ſince come. Surely, there is but <hi>one Chriſt,</hi> though thus variouſly ſet forth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Covenant which was capable of being <hi>renewed,</hi> after it was <hi>broken,</hi> muſt needs be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and not of Works. But the covenant made with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>renewing.</hi> The covenant of Works being once broken, is irreparably broken, becauſe it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>abſolute, perfect</hi> Obedience. But the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were oft called to renew their covenant with God, which ſheweth it was a <hi>Covenant of Grace. Moſes, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. who truly feared God, and full well knew their own and others weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and utter inability to <hi>perform ſinleſs</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would never have been ſo forward to engage themſelves, and others in a covenant of Works; which was impoſſible for them to keep, whereby they could expect nothing but a curſe.</p>
                  <p>The covenant of Works admitteth not of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, promiſeth not Remiſſion thereupon: But there was place for Repentance, and a promiſe of Pardon and Forgiveneſs in that covenant made with
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:152819:167"/>the <hi>Iſraelites, Lev.</hi> 26.40, 42. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.30, 31.</p>
                  <p>There was a way appointed under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament for the Expiation of ſin. The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law were Types of Chriſt, and to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our obtaining Remiſſion by his Blood. Doth the covenant of works admit of Sacrifices for ſin? What a veil is over their eyes, in reading the Old Teſtament, that make it a covenant of works, when the great thing pointed at by its <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> is Chriſt, and Redemption by him! VVill any ſay, the covenant of works, was Typical of the covenant of Grace?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That Covenant which had the <hi>ſame condition</hi> with the Goſpel-covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commands; is for ſubſtance the ſame covenant, that is, <hi>a Covenant of Grace.</hi> But the covenant made with the <hi>Jews.</hi> had this ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The covenant of works would not <hi>take up with Sincere</hi> Obedience, but ſtrictly requireth, and exacteth Perfect Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But as God in his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his walking uprightly. So this was the thing required of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 10.12.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though one hath raiſed a great duſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, calling it a <hi>Mixt-covenant:</hi> Of what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples was it mixt? Was it a Mixture of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and the Covenant of Grace? <hi>A compound</hi> of both theſe? But at other times, they will ſay theſe two are <hi>Incompaſſibilia,</hi> things that will not mix, and conſiſt together; you may as ſoon <hi>mingle Heaven and Earth</hi> together. If Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation be of works, then of Debt, and conſequently not of Grace: So one of theſe plainly <hi>excludes,</hi> and overthrows the other. That either they muſt bring it to a Covenant of works, and not of Grace, or <hi>vice verſâ,</hi> to a Covenant of Grace and not of VVorks. Or was it a mixt Covenant becauſe it contained <hi>Temporal promiſes,</hi> as well as Spiritual; yet obſerve, this could not hinder its being a Covenant of Grace. For, 1. Thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things promiſed were Typical of higher, and better, even of Spiritual things. An earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was <hi>a Type of Heaven.</hi> And long Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Obedient, was promiſed as an <hi>earneſt</hi> to Eternal Life, And whatever ſome ſay and think,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:152819:170"/>this conſideration would commend, and ſet off thoſe outward Temporal bleſſings promiſed to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that they were Types and Pledges of Spiritual and Heavenly things. That they might ſay, as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. And this was yet a <hi>ſmall thing</hi> in thy ſight, O Lord God, but thou haſt alſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thy ſervants for a <hi>great while to come;</hi> haſt ſpoken what thou wilt do for us hereafter, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. How great is thy Goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them, that fear thee, beſides all that Goodneſs of thine laid out upon them here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Goſpel it ſelf</hi> contains promiſes of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Temporal-bleſſings, as well as Spiritual. Chriſt hath promiſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 33. All theſe things <hi>ſhall be added,</hi> to them that ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven firſt. And ſtill that holds good to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, [I will <hi>never leave thee,</hi> nor forſake thee, <hi>Heb,</hi> 13.5, 6. Godlineſs not only heretofore had, but ſtill hath the promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:152819:171"/>For by this Reaſon, the Goſpel, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, that <hi>the meek ſhall Inherit the Earth,</hi> Mat. 5. ſhould be a mixt Covenant. That the promiſe of an Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhould make ſuch a mixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and no other <hi>promiſe of the Earth,</hi> or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſings do it; is ſuch a groundleſs Fancy, as will never be proved while the Earth ſtands.</p>
                  <p>Nor the latter. For ſo the Goſpel ſhould be a <hi>mixt Covenant</hi> too. As the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in ſpecial to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed; and as it was promiſed, that the Meſſiah ſhould come of his ſeed: So in the beginning of the Goſpel, there was a <hi>ſpecial promiſe of Miracles,</hi> to credit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Faith of thoſe, who firſt believed in Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>Theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe.</hi> In my Name they ſhall caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents, &amp;c. Which promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to us, as <hi>thoſe ſigns</hi> are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now: Muſt we therefore ſay, that was a mixt Covenant made with thoſe Primitive belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>different from the Covenant of Grace</hi> we are under? Surely it is called the Covenant of Grace, from the <hi>main eſsential promiſes</hi> of Grace, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: I ſay, it hath its Denomination from thoſe Grand promiſes, which God made to his Church and People in <hi>all Ages;</hi> and which make it the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, notwithſtanding a difference, and change in certain acceſſions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials.</p>
                  <p>So if it alledged, that the Old Teſtament doth more abound with Temporal promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is ready, <hi>Magis &amp; Minus non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant Speciem.</hi> More and Leſs ſhew different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

Though the <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>more of the Earth</hi> promiſed, and Chriſtians <hi>more of the Spirit,</hi> this will only prove Chriſtians under a better diſpenſation of the Covenant; it will not <hi>diſprove</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> being under a Covenant of Grace, ſince beſides their temporal, they had alſo ſpiritual Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Had the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews</hi> been a covenant of Grace, the ſame for ſubſtance with the Goſpel covenant, then Chriſt ſhould have been the <hi>Mediator</hi> of it; but <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of that Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Inaſmuch as that Covenant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> did admit of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> this ſheweth it was not a covenant of works. The covenant of works hath no Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> as he was Mediator was a <hi>type</hi> of Chriſt, therefore Chriſt was the <hi>true Mediator,</hi> even then as well as now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſter day, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Indeed Chriſt is called the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6.

(in which reſpect he is called a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.) So the better covenant was delivered, the better diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the covenant was ſet <hi>forth by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.) as it was fit he ſhould have the Honour of it.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>virtue of Chriſts blood</hi> did certainly extend to the times of the Old Teſtament. And was not that Blood, wherewith the firſt Teſtament was Dedicated, <hi>Typical</hi> of the blood of Chriſt? Now how abſurd is it to talk of a Covenant of works <hi>typical</hi> of a Covenant of Grace, (as Mr. <hi>Patient,</hi> holds it is, who makes this Objection.) How ſtrange were it, if a Covenant of works ſhould be <hi>ſo Dedicated,</hi> as to repreſent Chriſt and his Benefits; which is the ſoul and ſubſtance of the Covenant of Grace. Indeed, as a Modern writer notes:

                  <p>The Goſpel-covenant is called <hi>a new Covenant;</hi> not but that the Covenant made with the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, was the ſame for ſubſtance, as otherwiſe <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> had not been of the <hi>Jews:</hi> But becauſe though theſe were the ſame <hi>for ſubſtance,</hi> yet they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in reſpect of Adminiſtration.

To all which I may add one ſort more: The <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that hence conclude, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not a <hi>covenant of Grace,</hi> and of Salvation; but a Covenant of Outward and Temporal Priviledges, or as the more Ignorant ſort of them, a <hi>covenant of Works.</hi> And ſo Mr. <hi>Patient</hi> will have it. But, 1. If that Covenant made formerly with the <hi>Jews</hi> was a covenant of VVorks, not of Grace, then God was <hi>Married</hi> unto them by a <hi>covenant of Works:</hi> As <hi>ver.</hi> 32. he ſaith, He was an Husband unto them. But it is not to be imagined, that God ſhould be Married unto ſinners, by a covenant of VVorks. 2. That which is here called a <hi>New covenant,</hi> meaneth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a New diſpenſation of the Covenant, which ſhould be at the Meſſiahs coming in Goſpel-times. <hi>Called New,</hi> for the great change there ſhould be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:152819:175"/>for the better in manner of Adminiſtration, in which reſpect it might ſeem to be a <hi>New covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> 3. The truth of this ſecond particular will appear, if we conſider what this New covenant is: [<hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts:</hi> &amp;c.] which is ſpoken <hi>comparate, non abſolute.</hi> Not as if God had not done this for them before in ſome meaſure; but that he would do it in a <hi>further mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> [I will put my Law in their inwards parts.] This God had done for ſome of them before, as he had promiſed this before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. There was ſome among them that could ſay as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy <hi>Law is within my heart.</hi> But that Grace which was more rare under the Old Teſtament, is promiſed to be extended to more, more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>diffuſed</hi> under the New. And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of [I will make a New covenant— not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant that I made with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.]</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſuppoſeth what is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the Covenant of Grace lieth <hi>wholly on Gods part,</hi> and nothing is required of man therein. But I have undeniably proved before, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace hath <hi>Conditions,</hi> conditions not <hi>required of God,</hi> but of men: As 'tis not required of God, but of man to Believe, Repent, Obey, ſincerely. And if any of us do not come up to <hi>theſe Terms,</hi> and Duties, whereunto we ſtand
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:152819:175"/>bound, we are guilty of breach of covenant. If God and Man be not mutually engaged; if all lieth wholly on Gods part, and Man is to do nothing, then it is an <hi>abſolute Promiſe,</hi> not a Covenant.</p>

                     <hi>Preſton</hi> indeed ſpeaks of a <hi>double Covenant,</hi> which cannot be broken, where God engageth to work the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in ſome, but that is <hi>reſtrained to the Elect.</hi> Others reduce it to that which is called the Covenant of Redemption, betwixt God and Chriſt. But the <hi>Covenant properly with Man,</hi> that covenant, according to the terms and tenor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are to look for Remiſſion and Salvation, is <hi>conditional;</hi> and in the tenders of it, common both to Elect and Reprobate.

                  <p>Yea, I do not queſtion but Believers themſelves are generally to be humbled for this ſin, that they have broken <hi>covenant</hi> with God. They may have been guilty of breaking covenant with him for a time, who yet do not <hi>finally</hi> break covenant with him.</p>
                  <p>Further, I would ask one that is of Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion here (whether Anabaptiſt, or other) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all in their ſocieties be not perſons <hi>entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant?</hi> And next, whether there be no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in their ſocieties? And then, whether any Hypocrite, while an hypocrite, keepeth Covenant.</p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:152819:176"/>
                  <p>Certainly the Covenant that Chriſtian Churches are taken into, which is <hi>ſealed in Baptiſm,</hi> may be broken, and is broken by ſome, if there are any Hypocrites within the viſible Church, that is, if the <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> Church be not all one. It is as little to be doubted, that there are perſons in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, who yet break it, and ſhall be judged as Violators of it; as that there are branches in Chriſt that bear not Fruit, and therefore ſhall be cut off, and taken away, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2.</p>

As to the Elect it is true, they do not <hi>totally and finally</hi> break Covenant; and that Grace enabling to keep the Covenant, is given out to a far greater Number than before; but we cannot ſay ſimply and abſolutely, that the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant is never broken.</p>

As re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>Jews</hi> common-wealth, ſo this was the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> by which they were all to be
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:152819:177"/>governed, as a Common-wealth. And this Law was two-fold, to wit, 1. The ſtrict <hi>Original Law,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Obedience to all Gods commands, whether Moral, Judicial, or Ceremonial, <hi>upon pain of death;</hi> ſo a violent temporal Death was due to every one that failed in obſerving any external Precept of the Law. 2. The Remedying Law anſwering to it, which appointed a Sacrifice to be offered <hi>in moſt caſes,</hi> upon which the Offendor and Tranſgreſſor was diſcharged from the aforeſaid temporal Death threatned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame Law (that is, materially the ſame) is alſo to be conſidered, as reſpecting <hi>conſcience.</hi> And here we are to take notice likewiſe, 1. The <hi>Original Law</hi> here was ſo wonderfully ſtrict, and dreadfully ſevere, that it threatned an eternal curſe, <hi>everlaſting death,</hi> to any the leaſt tranſgreſſion whatſoever. As it had to do with Conſcience, it threatned Death Eternal to every Sin, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſecret ſins, in heart or thought; ſuch things as it did not take notice of, or threaten with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temporal Death, as it was their <hi>Common-wealth Law.</hi> 2. The <hi>Remedying Law</hi> anſwering to it, and given with it, which was to this purpoſe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were, all of them, many wayes guilty of the breach of Gods moſt holy Law, and ſo <hi>obnoxious to the curſe;</hi> yet ſuch was his Grace, that upon their ſincere Repentance, and real and hearty Endeavours to obey God in all things, their ſins ſhould be pardoned, and their Souls ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Now taking the Law in this laſt ſence, as it <hi>held forth pardon</hi> and ſalvation to ſinners upon their hearty return to God, and ſincere Obedience, ſo there is <hi>no Oppoſition</hi> betwixt this Remedying Law, and the Goſpel. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of it, calleth it <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:152819:177"/>word of Faith,</hi> the ſame <hi>which we preach,</hi> Rom. 10.8. So it was the <hi>Salvation of the Jews,</hi> Joh. 4.22. the means of ſalvation to thoſe that were ſaved.</p>
                  <p>As it was their <hi>common-wealth</hi> Law, it typified higher things. Firſt, in that it threatned every tranſgreſſion with Death, it ſhewed the wonderfull ſtrictneſs of Gods Law, as in an <hi>higher ſence,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eternal Death to every ſin. Again, as there was a Remedying Law, given with it, appointing in moſt caſes, a Beaſt to be ſlain, to prevent the Death of the Offender, it was a <hi>typical Goſpel,</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing out the Reconciliation of ſinners by a more excellent Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is another diſtinction I would have you take notice of, to wit, that we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Law, <hi>as it was given by God,</hi> and as it was <hi>miſtaken</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi> by many of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Law was given by God, we may be ſure, as Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> hath well noted, <q>It was not to croſs, or confront the Promiſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diſcourſe of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> p. 55.</note> or Gods deſign in it, but to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes?</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. For it is not to be thought that God would prevaricate in his Deſign. So that when he had once made <hi>a new Law of Grace,</hi> for the ſaving of Fallen man, he would yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards give any Law, but what ſhould one way or other ſubſerve to the ſame end, if men do not deprive themſelves of the intended Benefit, by perverting it. And therefore to be ſure, God did not intend to revive the Old covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:152819:178"/>
                  <p>Now to apply theſe things to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when the Apoſtle makes an <hi>oppoſition</hi> betwixt the Old Teſtament and the New; the Law and the Goſpel; the works of the Law, and Faith; we are either to underſtand him, as ſpeaking of the Law, ſo far as it was <hi>political,</hi> concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: Thus indeed it made nothing perfect, it was but a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> and was to give place and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, the Subſtance being come: Or elſe he ſpeaks of the Law in a ſtrict ſence, abſtracted from thoſe <hi>gracious Promiſes</hi> that were given with it to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And thus it was a copy of the <hi>Law of works,</hi> requiring abſolute perfect Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was oppoſite to the Goſpel, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſevered it from, and ſet it up againſt the Doctrine of Gods Grace; and ſo it <hi>gendred to bondage, Gal.</hi> 4.24. and was the Miniſtration of Death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. So there was no being juſtified by the Law; or if men could have been juſtified by it, they had not been juſtified by Grace, there had been nothing of Pardon in it.</p>
                  <p>But otherwiſe the Apoſtle makes the Doctrine of the Old Teſtament all one with the Doctrine he preached, as we heard before.</p>
                  <p>And if at any other time he uſeth any <hi>derogating expreſſions,</hi> when he is ſpeaking of it, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them as ſpoken <hi>comparatively,</hi> that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that darker and more burdenſome admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, with this clearer and more comfortable diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> If you ask, how could the Law given to the <hi>Jews</hi> be conſidered both as a <hi>Law of works,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring perfect Obedience, and alſo as a <hi>Remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:152819:178"/>Law,</hi> taking up with ſincere Obedience?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Had the ſtrict Original Law been given to them <hi>intentionally</hi> to bind them up to it, to expect Life and Happineſs, onely upon thoſe high terms of doing all things therein contained, and obeying perfectly; then had it been plainly <hi>excluſive</hi> of a remedying Law: But it was not given thus, but the very intention of publiſhing the ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of the Law of <hi>works</hi> (which all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are under) was to commend and ſet forth the Graciouſneſs of the <hi>Remedying Law,</hi> to make it more welcome and acceptable. How gladly and thankfully ought they to have ſubmitted to that <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> which held forth pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God, upon their believing in him, and obeying ſincerely, of whom God might <hi>(in Juſtice)</hi> have required nothing leſs than perfect, ſinleſs Obedience.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it was a moſt horrible <hi>perverting</hi> of the Law, when the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and other ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſticiaries, expected Righteouſneſs, and Life from the Law, <hi>in their ſence,</hi> and in oppoſition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, For, 1. As it was the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> as it reſpected their Common-wealth, ſo (it is true) it was poſſible for them to keep the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. They might not be guilty of any ſuch <hi>external breach</hi> of the Law, as legally deſerved a violent temporal death, and ſuch as could not be <hi>expiated by Sacrifice,</hi> but all this could not juſtifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. As it was their Common-wealth Law, it was never given for that end; but to keep them in order, and to ſhadow out greater and higher things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it held forth the ſtrict Law of works, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:152819:179"/>perfect ſinleſs Obedience, ſo they could not poſſibly keep it, to <hi>be juſtified by it;</hi> but were all tranſgreſſors of the Law, and ſo condemned by it; which ſhould have moved them to embrace, and ſubmit to it in a <hi>Goſpel-ſence.</hi> And in keeping the Law ſincerely, heartily bewailing the ſinfull defects in their Obedience, and having recourſe to the free grace and mercy of God for pardon, they might have found acceptance, and an exceeding great reward.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. This may ſerve as an Antidote, againſt the Error of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who <hi>to out the children</hi> of profeſſing Parents of their Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, would fain perſwade men, that the <hi>Covenant made with the Jews</hi> (wherein children were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with their Parents) was not the ſame for ſubſtance; but quite of another kind. Now ſince we have proved <hi>the Old and New Covenant,</hi> the ſame Covenant of Grace for ſubſtance; their Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſhaken, and ſo what they would build upon it, not like to ſtand. If children were <hi>capable of being in covenant</hi> with God, with their Parents heretofore, why not now? Either they muſt ſay, our children are <hi>more incapable</hi> of a covenant Intereſt in God, than the children of the <hi>Jews;</hi> or that God is <hi>leſs Merciful,</hi> bears leſs reſpect to the children of his People now, than he did to the children of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Both which are <hi>loaded with abſurdity.</hi> But more of this afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This may help to keep up in us a reverent, and high eſteem of the Scriptures <hi>of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Wiſe men would not throw away their old <hi>Evidences.</hi> What you have heard, may let you ſee an <hi>Harmony</hi> betwixt the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yea, Chriſtians though they are not to keep up Jewiſh ceremonies; yet they may make better uſe of the Ceremonial Law, than the <hi>Jews</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily did, who reſted in the Letter of the Law, and were taken up with the outward ſhadows, <hi>not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end</hi> of that which is Aboliſhed. We may ſee the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of the Ceremonial Law
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:152819:181"/>more clearly, than the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did, having ſo fair and <hi>plain a Comment</hi> upon it in the Goſpel: As Prophecies are beſt Interpreted by their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; ſo Types by the coming of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, and comparing them together.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome that ſlight, and reject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Teſtament. This they never <hi>learnt</hi> of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles.

                     </gap>tion of God, is profitable, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. He Vindicates his Doctrine, and confirms it from the <hi>Scriptures of the Old Teſtament,</hi> Acts 26.22, 23. And we find the <hi>Bereans</hi> commended for their ſearching thoſe Scriptures, and <hi>trying Doctrines</hi> by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. The Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, (as we learn, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20.) are one <hi>Foundation</hi> of Faith. Chriſtians are there ſaid to be built <hi>upon the Foundation</hi> (not Foundations) of the Apoſtles and Prophets. That to take away the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, is to take away <hi>part of the Foundation.</hi> We have a more ſure word of Prophecy, (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye do well, that ye take heed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This may further confirm us in the belief of the Goſpel. That it is no <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it was held forth of old by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets; upon which account there is <hi>leſs Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to ſuſpect the truth of it. The main Doctrine
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:152819:182"/>of the Goſpel is non other, than what God hath Owned, and Delivered to his <hi>Church of old,</hi> Acts 26.22. <hi>Antiquity</hi> is a thing which many would pretend to follow. Well, this is the antient Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: And it is proved to be of God; as by the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought to confirm it, with other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo by the <hi>writings of Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>John</hi> 5.46. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24. It hath double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. We have <hi>old Evidences</hi> to ſhew for it, to make it good. As God ſpake by the Mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been ſince the world began, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence we may ſee cauſe to admire Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing with us, under the <hi>Goſpel-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Covenant. The <hi>Jews</hi> were highly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, in being taken into that Covenant God made with them; though it was a <hi>darker Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. Now God hath done more for us, than he did for that his antiently-beloved People, taking us into <hi>the ſame</hi> Covenant for ſubſtance, (it is true, but) in a clearer, a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſpenſation</hi> of it. Many Kings and Prophets, and Righteous men among them, deſired to ſee the things which we ſee, yet did not ſee them. The <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore were <hi>priviledged above</hi> any Nation in the world; yet we are priviledged above them: we that live in Goſpel-times, we have the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, in the laſt and <hi>beſt Edition</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This ſhews what ground Chriſtians have to apply Old Teſtament Promiſes, ſuch as are of a <hi>common concern:</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells them, they ſhould be no looſers by ſubmitting to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent and be Baptized.— For the Promiſe is to you, and to your children;</hi> and

But in a ſtricter ſence, as here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. Gods Covenant ſtood faſt with them. And that Grace which others had offered to them, but wickedly rejected, theſe willingly embraced, and were bleſſed in.

So the Apoſtles intent is to deny to the <hi>Natural</hi> ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that which was the Priviledge of the <hi>Spiritual ſeed</hi> only, (not to deny to the Spiritual ſeed ſuch Priviledge as was even common to the <hi>Natural ſeed,</hi>) ſo likewiſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:152819:185"/>Queſtion the Apoſtle ſpeaks to here, is not whether only true Believers are in Covenant, or whether the Parents being in Covenant, their Children are not in Covenant with them; but rather, whether they that are only Externally in Covenant, may not be broken off.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew the Uſe of this Diſtinction of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Externally</hi> in Covenant, and of a being alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in Covenant:</p>

It would ſeem that <hi>in what ſence</hi> God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the God of believers, he hath alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be the God of their Seed, while they are to be looked on purely as their Seed; for ſo they are Intereſted in the Covenant upon the Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, without any thing more required of them, But now the Covenant made with believers and their ſeed, hath ſuch and ſuch <hi>Conditions,</hi> required of all that are of Age, and not naturally uncapable of performing the ſame.

That he ceaſeth to be a believer; it would certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Covenant of Grace would ceaſe to <hi>juſtifie him,</hi> that he ſhould not be ſaved. So the Children of believers, if as they grow up, they do not come up to Covenant-Terms; that Covenant that would have juſtified them, dying Infants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring no more of them at that Age, than what might have been <hi>pleaded</hi> for them; yet that ſame Covenant will condemn them as Violaters of it.

                  <p>If I have been miſtaken in what is here ſaid of the ſalvation of believers Children, that die in their Infancy; yet I can ſay, I deſire to Learn, and am willing to ſee my miſtakes. But though I know not, that the Scripture, which affirmeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.2. That we are all <hi>Children of wrath</hi> by Nature, doth any where hold forth the Salvation of all that die in Infancy; which to <hi>aſsert,</hi> would ſeem to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> that Gods deſtroying the old World, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. were eminent Acts of <hi>Mercy,</hi> rather than of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> where in ſuch multitudes of ſouls were ſent to Heaven together; who if they had lived, had probably (at leaſt, for the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of them) gone to Hell. And how it may be Reconciled with that Reaſon, God giveth the angry Prophet, for his ſparing <hi>Nineveh, Jon.</hi> 4.11. That there were more than Sixſcore Thouſand perſons that could <hi>not diſcern betwixt the Right hand and the Left,</hi> I am not able to diſcern; if theſe (ſuppoſing <hi>Ninevehs</hi> Deſtruction, and their Fall <hi>in the Ruine of it</hi>) had all then been certainly ſaved, and not one of many of them (probably) ſaved, their Lives (with the reſt of the City) <hi>being ſpared.</hi> Yet methinks it ſhould be granted, that there is more hope of the Salvation of the Infants of believers, than of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. Now that there is ſo, it muſt be becauſe of their Intereſt in the Covenant, There were no more hope of the Salvation of the one, than of the other, if they were both alike Intereſted in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is a being only <hi>Externally</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as well as a being <hi>Internally:</hi> This would teach us not to expect a Church upon Earth, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſtituted, or conſiſting only of Real Saints. Certainly, all whom the Apoſtles themſelves Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:152819:187"/>and admitted into Chriſtian Fellowſhip, and Communion, were not <hi>true Converts,</hi> or real Saints. And when Three Thouſand were admitted, all in one day (as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) how was it probable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed poſſible, to take a particular account of each one, touching a <hi>work of Grace,</hi> and to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſoundneſs of their Converſion. The Viſible Church is a Field that hath <hi>Tares,</hi> as well as <hi>Wheat.</hi> It's not to be expected, that <hi>all the Tares,</hi> ſhould be gathered out, till the end of the World. Then it is, that the Son of man ſhould ſend forth his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.40, 41. That ſuch are ſaid to be gathered out <hi>of his Kingdom</hi> then, it implieth there are, and will be ſuch in his Kingdom till then. Again, <hi>ver.</hi> 47. The Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a <hi>Draw-net,</hi> which here encloſeth Fiſh, both good and bad; and I would fain know, what Church we may find in all the New Teſtament, that was conſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves, all whoſe Members were to have been accounted <hi>real Saints,</hi> ſuch as had true ſaving Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there are ſome only Externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and not Internally; this ſhould teach and <hi>warn us,</hi> not to reſt in the former. As <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaid to them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Think not within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our Father:</hi> So, think it not enough, to have been born of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents, or that you have <hi>been Baptized,</hi> or that you are Gods People by External profeſſion; but walk in the ſteps of the Faithful, and as you have given up your Names, ſo give up <hi>your ſelves</hi>

                     </gap>o Chriſt. As I may allude to that of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:152819:187"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. He is not a Chriſtian, who is ſo only <hi>outwardly,</hi> neither is that Baptiſm, which is only an outward waſhing of the Fleſh: But he is a Chriſtian indeed, who is ſo <hi>inwardly,</hi> and that is Baptiſm indeed, where the heart is cleanſed, and where there is the anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. And the Covenant of Grace may well be compared to <hi>Noahs Ark;</hi> as it was not hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the outſide of the Ark, that would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any of the Old World, but getting within the Ark, as <hi>Noah</hi> did. So our being Externally in Covenant with God will not avail to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs we are alſo Internally in Covenant, coming up to Covenant-Terms.

                  <p>But the greatneſs of theſe Covenant-priviledges will appear in the ſad and deplorable Eſtate of thoſe that want, or are deprived of them. See what it is for men to be ſtrangers to the Covenant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Such are ſaid to be <hi>without Chriſt, without hope,</hi> and <hi>without God in the World.</hi> How dolefull is their condition, who can never hear the <hi>joyfull ſound.</hi> To want the ordinary <hi>Means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is a want indeed: Ordinarily, <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus,</hi> Acts 2.47. <hi>Where no Viſion is, there the people periſh.</hi> Such ſit in Darkneſs, and in the Region and ſhadow of Death.</p>
                  <p>How miſerable was the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were unchurched, when God called them <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> would no longer own them as a people in Covenant with him. Then <hi>wrath</hi> is ſaid to have

                     <hi>come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> It made the Apoſtle ſad at heart to think of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Now what is ſaid of the Priviledges of thoſe who are but ſo much as <hi>externally</hi> in Covenant with God, ſhould <hi>quicken us to Duty,</hi> not breed, or nouriſh ſecurity. The greater our Mercies, the greater our Engagements. The higher our <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> the greater Gods <hi>Expectations.

As this is the Tenour of the Covenant,</hi> I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</head>
                  <p>NOw to clear this, obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This hath been Gods Way and Manner all along, when he hath taken Parents into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to <hi>take in their ſeed</hi> with them.

                  <p>The Covenant <hi>of Works</hi> was made with <hi>Adam</hi> for himſelf and his Poſterity, I ſuppoſe that will be readily granted. And when the Covenant of works <hi>was broken</hi> on mans part, that there was no poſſibility of attaining Happineſs that way, God made another Covenant <hi>with our</hi> firſt Parents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Salvation by the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> that is,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:152819:190"/>Jeſus Chriſt, who was to be born of a Virgin, which was the <hi>firſt Edition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, as I ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>And here the ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> were not excluded, but included; till ſuch time as any of them cut off themſelves from Gods Covenant by their own <hi>Act and Deed.</hi> Who are we to underſtand by the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. but the ſeed of godly Parents, ſuch as were deſcended from <hi>Seth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, &amp;c.</hi> who are called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were his Creatures? for ſo they ſhould not have been oppoſed to the <hi>Daughters of men,</hi> as there they are. <hi>Have not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</hi> Mal. 2.10. Nor are they called the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as being regenerated, and made <hi>new Creatures:</hi> For no ſuch thing appears in the Context, but rather the contrary. But they are called the <hi>Sons of God</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are called the <hi>children of the Lord their God,</hi> Deut. 14.1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Church, and in Covenant-relation to God.

                  <p>Methinks theſe things are very plain,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of a breaking off from, and of being graffed into the <hi>viſible Church.</hi> For, 1. There is no breaking from the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church. If a member of the inviſible Church may
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:152819:194"/>be <hi>broken off,</hi> then a true Believer may fall away from Grace. 2. The breaking off here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was from that Church, of which the unbelieving Jews were <hi>natural branches, v.</hi> 24. Now they were natural branches of the Viſible, not of the Inviſible Church. 3. That Church into which the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Gentile-profeſſors were <hi>graffed</hi> (in the the room of the Jews that were broken off,) was the Viſible Church; for many of them were not members of the Inviſible Church. They that were moſt apt to boaſt againſt the <hi>natural branches,</hi> and were in danger of being cut off, as well as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 21. were no better than <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſts,</hi> and out-ſide Chriſtians, who had onely a ſtanding in the Viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>ſome</hi> of the Jews onely were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, <hi>v.</hi> 17. And if <hi>but ſome</hi> of the Jews were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, then ſome of them remained branches of the Olive ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that were broken off, were broken off, <hi>they and their ſeed,</hi> from the Church, and from the Covenant: They that were not broken off, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, <hi>they and their ſeed,</hi> within the Church, within the Covenant. For,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. None were broken off, but <hi>becauſe</hi> of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>ſcil.</hi> their own, or their Parents. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infants of the believing Jews were not <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</hi> They could not be broken off becauſe of their Parents unbelief, when their Parents were Believers; nor for their <hi>own unbelief,</hi> when they were not capable of rejecting Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in their own perſons. How could thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which were <hi>within the Church,</hi> and Covenant, before their Parents embraced the Goſpel, be caſt
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:152819:195"/>out, and cut off before they came actually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt and the Goſpel. If the Children of the believing Jews were not continued in the <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> with their Parents, to partake of the root and fatneſs thereof, then it will follow, that they were in the ſame ſtate with <hi>thoſe broken off.</hi> Now how ſtrange is it, that they who were once in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and within the Church, received for their Fathers ſakes, ſhould be caſt out again, without any fault of their own, or their Parents? would God revoke ſuch a priviledge granted his people for their ſeed, unprovoked?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Unbelief which <hi>brake off</hi> many of the Jews, was not barely the privation of true, ſaving, juſtifying Faith; but a poſitive, open, <hi>wilfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> of Chriſt and the Goſpel. Which is plain thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe divers who were not broken off were unbelievers in that firſt ſence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. VVhat State and <hi>Priviledges</hi> the unbelieving Jews were broken off from, unto that ſtate, and to thoſe Priviledges, the main body of that People were again to be reſtored, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. The Apoſtle teacheth, they were to be graffed again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>their own Olive-tree.</hi> Now if their Children were not to be taken in with them, it would not be their <hi>own Olive,</hi> they were graffed in; but a Church of a quite different conſtitution, from what it was before the breaking off.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If the Children of the Jews that kept their place in the Church, and of them that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be taken in, muſt be looked on, as in an <hi>oppoſite ſtate</hi> to that of the off-broken branches; we muſt ſay the ſame of the children of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile proſeſſors. The <hi>believing Gentiles</hi> are graffed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:152819:195"/>into that ſtate from whence the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were broken, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.24. And there is now no <hi>Partition-wall;</hi> but <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. The <hi>Jews</hi> have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge now above the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And beſides, this was not the <hi>ſole priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> before, but of any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well, that became Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, if they were <hi>Proſelytes of the Covenant;</hi> their Children were taken into the Church, and into the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> were graffed into the ſame Viſible Church with the <hi>Jews,</hi> then they were to be Circumciſed, as the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     </gap>he Apoſtle ſaith, [If thou wert cut out of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-tree,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:152819:196"/>which is wilde by Nature; and wert graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed <hi>contrary to Nature,</hi> into a good Olive-tree.] Is to be underſtood of thoſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were called out of Paganiſm, Heatheniſm, whoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents were without the Church, ſtrangers to the Covenant. But theſe being graffed into the good Olive-tree, their Children are buds, or Sprouts of the ſame Olive; as well as the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Natural branches,</hi> were. And yet we acknowledge it a great Favour of God towards ſuch Children, that they are deſcended of Parents, that are within Gods Covenant, and ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Covenant with their Parents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Text plain, and full for my preſent purpoſe, is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unclean; but now they are holy..</hi> This is a third Scripture I produce for Childrens Intereſt in the Covenant with the Parents: In the mouth of two or three witneſſes, the truth of what I laſt laid down, ſhall be eſtabliſhed. Theſe words are brought to remove a Scruple, which it ſeems trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the minds of ſome of the believing <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſcil.</hi> whereas ſome of them had unbelieving Yoke-follows, the doubt was, whether living with ſuch were not a <hi>defiling of Conſcience,</hi> a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; whether the Infidel Husband ſhould not be <hi>deſerted;</hi> and the wife remaining a Pagan, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, ſhould not be put away? Which the Apoſtle reſolveth in the Negative, that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Cohabitation, and Society with their unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Yoke-fellows, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>For the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Husband is ſanctified by, in, or to the believing Wife: Elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy,</hi> ver. 14. Here note, 1. That by the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:152819:196"/>
                     <hi>Wife,</hi> by, in, or to whom the <hi>unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> is ſanctified, we are to underſtand the <hi>believing Wife;</hi> and by the <hi>Husband,</hi> by whom, or in, or to whom, the unbelieving wife is ſanctified; we are to underſtand the <hi>believing Huſband.</hi> For, 1. It is ſuch a Wife as is oppoſed to an <hi>unbelieving Huſband.</hi> And otherwiſe it had been enough to ſay, Only the Husband is ſanctified by, or in the wife, and the wife is ſanctified by, or in the Husband. And the Term, or Epithite <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving]</hi> would be ſuperfluous in both places. But it is too great boldneſs for any to ſay, the Apoſtle adds this word Superfluouſly. 2. The ſame parties are called, <hi>a Brother, a Siſter,</hi> ver. 15. Again, 3. When the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>What knoweſt thou, O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Huſband? Or how knoweſt thou, O man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> It is only the <hi>believing wife,</hi> or Husband, that he would put in ſome hopes of gaining their unbelieving Yoke-fellows. 4. The Apoſtle would not ſay, that the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by, or to the <hi>believing</hi> wife, or by, or to the wife, though an unbeliever. He affirmeth the contrary, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. To the unbelieving <hi>nothing is pure,</hi> or ſanctified. If nothing be ſanctified to them, then no Relation is ſanctified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That when he ſpeaks of their Children being <hi>holy,</hi> he ſpeaks of Believers Children, as ſuch. To call the Children of Pagans, and Infidels, <hi>holy,</hi> is a ſtrange, uncouth ſpeech; and ſuch as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not acquainted with. But that the Children of Gods People are an <hi>holy Seed,</hi> this the Scripture owneth, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore when he calleth their Children <hi>holy,</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:152819:197"/>he muſt neceſſarily mean more than <hi>Legitimate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, 1. The Children of Infidels, if begotten in lawful wedlock were <hi>Legitimate,</hi> as well as theirs. But what the Apoſtle ſayes here, he ſaith only of a believers Children, not of the Children of Pagans, and Infidels. Here the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, or granteth, that if one of the Parents had not been a believer, and ſo the other Parent ſanctified (by virtue of the Covenant) in, or to him, then the Children indeed had been <hi>unclean,</hi> not <hi>holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that take <hi>[holy]</hi> for Legitimate, muſt take the word <hi>[ſanctified]</hi> for made lawful; in the foregoing clauſes. But they will never find the word <hi>[ſanctified]</hi> uſed only for that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Beſides, ſo the Apoſtle ſhould argue weakly, that it is lawful for the believer to live with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Yoke-fellow, becauſe it is lawful. Again, this of the unbelieving Husband <hi>being ſanctified</hi> by, or to the believing VVife; they that are not minded to wrangle, may ſee plainly is made an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> or conſequent of her being a believer; but that which was not lawful before, cannot be made <hi>lawful</hi> by ones believing: Or if it was lawful before, then it is not ones believing that made it ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Taking [holy] for <hi>Legitimate,</hi> the Apoſtle ſhould go about to prove <hi>Ignotum per ignotius:</hi> To clear one thing doubted of, he ſhould bring in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which might poſſibly be more <hi>doubted of:</hi> Which is going about indeed. Might not one of theſe believers have leſs doubt, whether ſuch an Infidel was his wife, than whether the Children were indeed his children? The Apoſtle argues here as from an <hi>acknowledged Principle,</hi> that they were well
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:152819:197"/>ſatisfied of; that their Children were not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>unclean,</hi> but <hi>holy.</hi> Now would any man think the Apoſtle ſo weak, to go about to prove, that ſuch a Couple were <hi>lawful man and wife,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Children were Legitimate. Or that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſo ſenſeleſs, as to doubt whether they lived not in <hi>Fornication,</hi> while they lived with their unbelieving Yoke-fellows; and yet to have no doubt, but that the Iſſue they had by them was <hi>Legitimate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhall never find the word <hi>[holy]</hi> uſed for <hi>Legitimate.</hi> Then is not that likely to be a <hi>private Interpretation,</hi> that takes it ſo here? And is it to be imagined, that when the Apoſtle is writing to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>ſcrupulous Conſciences,</hi> he would uſe a word in that ſence, they were none of them likely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; as being never uſed, and taken in ſuch a ſence before, and that without any thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Taking the word <hi>[Holy]</hi> for <hi>Legitimate,</hi> it would follow, that the Apoſtle is beſides the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and does not ſpeak to the <hi>Corinthians ſcruple.</hi> Have not they a ſtrong fancy, who can conceit ſuch a thing, that diverſe of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> becauſe their Yoke-fellows remained <hi>Infidels,</hi> were afraid, if they Lived with them ſtill, they ſhould be guilty of the ſin of <hi>Fornication,</hi> and defile their bodies? But we have no ground to think this troubled them, as if they feared, this were to be diſhoneſt: No, <hi>Marriage is honourable among all,</hi> Heb. 13.4. And yet though Marrirge be <hi>lawful in it ſelf,</hi> they might ſcruple notwithſtanding, whether to live in ſociety with ſuch as were Idolaters, and open Enemies to God, and Jeſus Chriſt; might not be <hi>Irreligious,</hi> and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:152819:198"/>a defiling of their Conſciences. Now this being their ſcruple, not the other, What <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> could it be, to tell them, that their Marriage was lawful <hi>on a civil account,</hi> ſo that their Children were Legitimate, not Baſtards? Notwithſtanding that, they might fear Spiritual defilement in it.</p>
                  <p>Lay all theſe particulars together, and I hope, when the Apoſtle ſays of theſe believers Children, that they were <hi>holy,</hi> you will be ſatisfied; he muſt mean ſomething more, than that they were not <hi>Baſtards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And therefore how can we underſtand it, but that they are <hi>holy in relation</hi> to God, holy as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to God. Holy, by virtue of his Covenant with the believer, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi> So if but one of the Parents be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant, it takes in the Seed with him: Till the oppoſite party can find out ſome other ſence, and make it out to be the ſence, this muſt ſtand.</p>
                  <p>All muſt grant, that the general uſe of the word <hi>[holy]</hi> is for a thing or perſon ſeperated to God. Which Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>

A Thing or Perſon may be Holy, or ſeperated to God, either <hi>in ſtate</hi> and ſtanding Relation, or only for ſome <hi>particular Act,</hi> or Uſe. Infants, while Infants, are not capable of any ſuch work for God: Therefore it is an <hi>Holineſs of ſtate,</hi> which is aſcribed to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <q>Thoſe that are holy thus in ſtate, are either Holy by <hi>meer Separation</hi> and Relation; or elſe they are alſo qualified with Endowments ſutable to the ſtate.</q>

                  <p>Now the word <hi>[Holy]</hi> conſtantly denoting a Thing, or Perſon <hi>ſeparated to God,</hi> either in State, or to ſome perticular Act, or Uſe; and Children being called <hi>holy,</hi> who are not capable, while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, of the latter way of ſeparation to God, but were known to have been <hi>ſeparated to God</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way, to ſtand in the ſame Covenant-relation with their Parents, and called an <hi>holy Seed;</hi> as when the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> are oft called an <hi>holy People, (Deut.</hi> 14.2. and 26.19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.24.) We are to underſtand not only the <hi>Adult,</hi> but the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the Infants among them, were a part of that <hi>boly People:</hi> Theſe things conſidered, we have no ground to underſtand what the Apoſtle ſays here of a believers Children being <hi>holy,</hi> otherwiſe, than that they are in Covenant-relation to God, as the Seed of his People formerly were; <hi>holy in ſtate,</hi>

                  <p>Now that it beſt ſuits with the ſcope of this place, appears thus; that here the Apoſtle would ſatisfie, and <hi>remove a ſcruple</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whether to live with their Yoke-fellows, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Infidels, were not <hi>Irreligious;</hi> and that that would defile their Conſciences?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This would make theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> as <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd men</hi> as were ever heard of, to doubt whether their Marriage was lawfull, in oppoſition to Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and yet to have <hi>no doubt,</hi> but their Children were legitimate. For it is impoſſible to know the children are legitimate, without knowing firſt, that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:152819:202"/>the Parents were lawfull Man and Wife. And they that doubt whether they are lawfull Man and Wife, cannot <hi>but doubt,</hi> whether their children are legitimate.

                  <p>He goes on, <q>The Believer had leaſt ground to doubt hereof, becauſe to him all <hi>lawfull</hi> things are <hi>clean</hi>— which is all the Holineſs I conceive can be meant in the Text, agreeable to the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3, 4. &amp; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15.

Yet it was poſſible that ſome of their Children, who were grown up, might not accept of Gods Covenant, and ſo not be proſelyted with their Parents: Now he may as well ſay, that <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed,</hi> did not hold good to Proſelytes, becauſe ſome of their ſeed might ſtill remain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt grant a concurrence here among Popiſh Expoſitors, taking <hi>holy</hi> for <hi>legitimate,</hi> and we know it is to ſerve a turn. For taking the word <hi>holy</hi> here to import their Covenant-relation unto God, as they are the Children of Believers; it does not favour their Tenent of the abſolute Neceſſity of Baptiſm to ſalvation: and further gives a ſad ſhake to their <hi>Limbus Infantum.</hi> But he can never ſhew a concurrence of Proteſtant Writers in his ſence.

                  <p>Further I deſire you to weigh this Argument, to prove Children in Covenant together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Either the children of Believers are taken into Covenant together with their Parents ſtill, or it is worſe with the Faithfull, in reſpect of their ſeed, now ſince the coming of Chriſt, than it was
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:152819:204"/>before. But it is no worſe now with the Faithfull in reſpect of their ſeed, than it was before. For that would make the Church a <hi>great loſer</hi> by Chriſts coming, whereas ſhe is a <hi>gainer.</hi> Then <hi>Chriſti ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu factum fuerit ut obſcurior &amp; minus teſtata ſit nobis Dei gratia quàm antè Judaeis erat,</hi> (as <hi>Calv.) Num poſt Chriſtum, factam eſſe deteriorem parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum ſortem exiſtimemus? Whitaker.</hi> It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that thoſe Jews, who <hi>embraced the Faith</hi> of Chriſt, if they onely had the Promiſe, that God would be their God, ſo that their children were <hi>left out,</hi> that God promiſed no longer to be the God of their Seed, then they could not but ſee themſelves in <hi>a worſe Condition,</hi> in reſpect of their children, than they were before. And how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is it to think, that when the Scripture makes cutting off from the Covenant ſo ſad a Judgement, and the fruit of Unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the believing Jews, which were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant once, ſhould be cut off upon their Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>(i. e.)</hi> cut off for no fault? And would not this be diſhonourable unto Chriſt, whoſe coming certainly was not to leſſen, but enlarge his peoples Priviledges? and according to this Doctrine, it ſhould have been a greater priviledge to be born under the Law, than to be born under the Goſpel. And how <hi>derogatory</hi> to the Grace of God, which he would have to ſhine forth more gloriouſly in the Goſpel-diſpenſation?</p>
                  <p>Whereas one ſayes, <q>This is no more to be eſteemed the loſs of a priviledge, than our not enjoying literally a Holy Land, City, Temple, a ſucceſſion of an High-prieſt, and a Prieſthood by Generation, or Lineal deſcent.]</q> We can tell
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:152819:205"/>them, we have <hi>greater mercies</hi> and priviledges in the room of theſe. But it is a wonderfull ſtrange thing, that any Chriſtian Parent ſhould account it <hi>no priviledge,</hi> for God to be the God of his ſeed. As heretofore he promiſed his people, to be the God of <hi>their ſeed.</hi> If the children of Gods people now are out of Covenant, I wonder what priviledge they can have, in lieu of that, which is denyed to them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſome tell us, The ſtate of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church is more <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> than to admit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; they may as well exclude all Infants out of Heaven. Doubtleſs, the ſtate of the <hi>Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant</hi> is as ſpiritual, as the ſtate of the Church Militant on Earth. If Infants may be Members of the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> what reaſon can be given, but Infants may be alſo members of the Church Militant on Earth? Indeed, if they are not <hi>of the Church,</hi> if they be not in Covenant, then are they in the ſame Eſtate with the Heathen, and the Jews that are broken off; that for the preſent we ſhould be without hope concerning them.</p>
                  <p>Again, methinks, there is ſomething of weight in this, to prove that our Children are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, as well as the children of the Jews were heretofore; becauſe it is as much our Duty to <hi>train them up for God,</hi> as ever it was the Duty of the Jews. What God required of the Jews, <hi>Deut,</hi> 6 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children,</hi> &amp;c. The like is required of us Chriſtians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. we muſt bring up our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Now how ſtrange were it, if God ſhould require us to train up our children for him, and yet not own
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:152819:205"/>them for his? Then we ſhould not have ſo much Encouragement to our Duty here, as the people of the Jews had before. Then the Jews had <hi>more help,</hi> more to hearten them to their Duty, than we. Can this be ſo, and yet we be under a <hi>better,</hi> a more gracious diſpenſation of the Covenant, than they? Surely, in this reſpect, we ſhould <hi>come ſhort</hi> of them. It will not enter into my thoughts, that where the Duty is the ſame to us, and to the Jews of old, we ſhould not have <hi>equal Priviledge</hi> with them at leaſt, and equal Encouragement to what they had.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I would ask thoſe that would race our childrens Names out of the Covenant, What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all thoſe <hi>gracious Promiſes</hi> of Old made to the ſeed of Gods people? That Promiſe, <hi>I will cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed.</hi> May not Believers plead this Promiſe ſtill, as well as heretofore the People of God might have done? And yet how can they do it, if their <hi>ſeed</hi> now are <hi>left out of</hi> Covenant? Does God make that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to any out of Covenant? So the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> So we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>The ſeed of the Righteous is bleſſed.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.9. <hi>They are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.23. <hi>They are the ſeed of the Bleſſed of the Lord, and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:152819:206"/>their Off-ſpring with them.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? That the people of God might have pleaded theſe Promiſes heretofore; but they do not concern us under the Goſpel? Then Believers now have no ground to plead them with God, or to <hi>hang their Off-ſpring and iſſue upon him,</hi> as his people had heretofore. And ſo there was more grace extended <hi>to the Jews</hi> under the former Diſpenſation of the Covenant. If ſuch Promiſes do as well concern us Chriſtians, as they did the Jews; if we may plead theſe Promiſes with God on the behalf of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, certainly they are <hi>Covenant-Promiſes.</hi> And if theſe Promiſes belong to our ſeed, the Covenant muſt as well belong to them. Remember that, God <hi>promiſeth ſuch things</hi> to none that are out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If it be objected, Theſe things are not made good to <hi>all the ſeed of the Jews:</hi> Yet I ſuppoſe it will not be denyed, but theſe were <hi>ſome of thoſe</hi> Promiſes which the Apoſtle reckoneth among the great Priviledges of the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9.4. And the Queſtion is, Whether ever God faileth of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Promiſes, but where there was ſome <hi>groſs failure</hi> on the Parents part, or on the Childes, or on both, their not doing their part towards the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of them.</p>
                  <p>I hope enough hath been ſaid to evince it, that where the Parents are in Covenant, their children are in Covenant too.</p>
                  <p>Now by way of Corollary and Inference, Note the <hi>Warrantableneſs of Infant-baptiſme.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtians being in Covenant together with their Parents, and Baptiſm being the <hi>initiating Sign and Seal</hi> of the Covenant; they that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, muſt needs have right to the initiating Seal
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:152819:206"/>of the Covenant. They that are known to be in Covenant, may be <hi>declared to be ſo</hi> by Baptiſm, (the Sign of entrance into Covenant,) that being an end of Baptiſm, to diſtinguiſh thoſe that are entred into Covenant with God, from thoſe who are not in Covenant. Certainly, <hi>to be in Covenant</hi> with God, is a greater matter than to have the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign:</hi> And there can be no reaſon to deny the outward ſign of entrance into the Covenant, to thoſe that we can prove entered into the Covenant, as children are together with their Parents.</p>
                  <p>And there was no other ground imaginable (I think) upon which ſuch ſtrangers as dwelt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jews, as their <hi>Servants,</hi> nor among them, as <hi>Sojourners,</hi> but in another Countrey, ſuch as the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27. were circumciſed, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and <hi>joyned to the Church</hi> of the Jews. There was no expreſs command for the circumciſing of ſuch Proſelytes as were neither Servants nor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers among them, yet were they circumciſed upon that <hi>general ground</hi> of their entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> taking him for their God; as if they had not been <hi>circumciſed,</hi> they had been debarred from joyning in Temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. (See <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28.) The Covenant, <hi>[I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed,]</hi> was the ground of the Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my covenant, therefore thou and thy ſeed,</hi> particularly, <hi>every male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child among you ſhall be circumciſed, in token of the Covenant.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>But againſt what I have laid down, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtians being in Covenant, they muſt needs have right to the <hi>initiatory Seal</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it is objected:</p>

But ſome will go further and Object, That if all within the Covenant have thereupon <hi>a Right</hi> to <hi>the Seal</hi> of <hi>Admiſſion,</hi> then it will follow, that the whole body of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have been Baptized, had a <hi>right to Babtiſm,</hi> being within the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have told you before, that though the Covenant of Grace be one and the <hi>ſame for ſubſtance</hi> in all Ages; yet there have been <hi>various diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of it. And as the Diſpenſations have differed, God has appointed <hi>different ſeals of Admiſſion.</hi> And as God hath revealed himſelf more plainly and fully in the Letter, than he had done in the former Diſpenſation; ſo <hi>proportionably</hi> more hath been required to mens being taken into Covenant in this Diſpenſation. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt was more Dark and Indeterminate. To <hi>Abraham</hi> he was promiſed to come out of his Loins, and that <hi>in his Seed all Nations ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> And under his Diſpenſation, God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only the belief of that general promiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Adam,</hi> that the <hi>Seed of the woman ſhould break the Serpents head;</hi> but alſo that the promiſed Meſſiah was to be of <hi>Abraham Seed.</hi> After this gracious Revelation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> this <hi>new Article
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:152819:208"/>of Faith</hi> was to be received, owned, and profeſſed in the Church, into which Circumciſion was a ſign and <hi>Seal of Entrance,</hi> and admiſſion. And when afterwards God delivered his Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then they that would <hi>joyn themſelves to the Church,</hi> muſt not only profeſs to believe the promiſed Meſſiah, but that he was willing to be Governed by thoſe Laws. And a <hi>Proſelyte of the Gate,</hi> as he was called, that had liberty to Dwell, or Sojourn among the <hi>Jews,</hi> only obſerving the <hi>ſeven Precepts</hi> given to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> (as they were called) was not owned as a Member of the Jewiſh Church, but diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Proſelyte of the Covenant,</hi> that was Circumciſed, and received the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Again, when Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, then was the cleareſt Diſpenſation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And then this became a new <hi>article of Faith</hi> to believe; that <hi>this was he.</hi> And when he appointed Baptiſm a Sign and <hi>Seal of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> into the Covenant, and Church under the Goſpel, the Faith of a <hi>Jew,</hi> to believe <hi>a Meſſias to come;</hi> was not enough, where the Faith of a Chriſtian was neceſſarily required, <hi>ſcil.</hi> To believe that <hi>this was he</hi> indeed, who was to come, and no other to be looked for. Now the <hi>Jews</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were <hi>in Covenant before,</hi> yet ſince this new Diſpenſation, if they will ſtick to the former Diſpenſation, and not admit of it in that <hi>further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> God is pleaſed to make, they can have no right to the Initiating Seal: But plainly caſt themſelves out of Covenant. I hope this is plain, and ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>But to ſtrengthen what we laid down before, I
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:152819:208"/>ſhall prove by Scripture, that Children, Infants, <hi>being in Covenant</hi> together with their Parents, they have a right to Baptiſm, the Initiating Seal of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And, 1. So much is implied in the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore, and Teach</hi> (or, as the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And this is undeniable, that Children are a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

And ſo Chriſt ſet his Apoſtles here upon a Task impoſſible to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>And methinks, it is very conſiderable, that <hi>[all Nations]</hi> here:

And if Children are part of thoſe, that were to be <hi>bleſsed in Chriſt,</hi> there can be no reaſon, when Chriſt ſays, <hi>[Go, Diſciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:, Baptizing them.]</hi> to exclude them from being comprehended here.</p>
                  <p>And further, That the Apoſtles had reaſon to take in Children, to Baptize Infants with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, (unleſs Chriſt had expreſly excepted) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence alſo, that the <hi>Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> was a thing well known, and commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Jewiſh Church before, when their Parents were <hi>Proſelyted.</hi> A Proſelyte was made with three things,

                  <p>And as yet, I ſee not any reaſon to be of Mr. <hi>George Galaſpy</hi>'s mind, who would have this of <hi>Baptizing Proſelytes,</hi> a corrupt Invention, or Tradition of the later <hi>Jews.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, it might very well be ſuppoſed, that the Heathen, who wanted the <hi>Rule to</hi> teach them to put a difference betwixt the Clean, and Unclean, (as <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.) were <hi>Legally unclean;</hi> in which caſe Waſhing was preſcribed by the Law. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Cleanſing,</hi> they were not to come to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to joyn in Gods Worſhip there. Before God gave the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, The Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Go unto the People, and ſanctifie them to Day, and to Morrow, and let them waſh their clothes,</hi> Exod 19.10. From this precept (ſays <hi>Ainſworth</hi>) the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors gather their Doctrine and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of baptizing</hi> all whom they admit to their Church and Covenant. But if they had reaſon to ſuppoſe the Heathen <hi>Legally unclean,</hi> as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how many ways that might come about, and how they had Lived before while Heathen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:152819:210"/>out any care to keep themſelves clean that way; it was an hundred to one, that any Proſelyte that came and offered himſelf, had ſome <hi>uncleanneſs on</hi> him: and conſidering that the <hi>unclean were unclean for ever</hi> (and in many caſes alſo defiled other things and perſons) till they were cleanſed; if there was one Law for them of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for any <hi>ſtranger,</hi> that ſhould joyn himſelf to them, (as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.15.) there would ſeem to have been <hi>ſufficient Warrant</hi> for this practice of their Waſhing, of Baptizing Proſelytes. Not like the <hi>practice of the Phariſees,</hi> Mark 7.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who added unto Gods Command for waſhing in caſe of Uncleanneſs, and placed Religion in their <hi>oft Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> though they had no <hi>Legal uncleanneſs</hi> on them.

                  <p>Indeed, I juſt now find in Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> [of the baptizing of Infants, <hi>pag.</hi> 473. this paſſage: <q>And that this Cuſtome of waſhing new born Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not any other ſort of Purification, was it; that this Baptiſm of Native <hi>Jews</hi> and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes referred to, may appear by that which in the <hi>Gemara,</hi> is ſaid of the baptized Proſelyte, that he was made [as an Infant new born.]</q> Which if it pleaſe our Oppoſites better, I ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with it.</p>

                  <p>And hence there was no ſuch need for the expreſs <hi>mentioning of Infants,</hi> ſuppoſing Chriſt would have them baptized, as for the expreſs excepting of Infants, ſuppoſing Chriſt would not have them baptized; becauſe as Doctor <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath well noted:

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:152819:212"/>little ones: As it is no way probable, that there ſhould be no <hi>little ones</hi> in any of their Families Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with compare what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now they are Holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now methinks there is ſomething in it, that the Scripture mentioneth <hi>divers houſholds</hi> being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, without excepting the <hi>little ones</hi> in any one houſhold baptized, and it is very ſtrange, if none of thoſe houſholds had little ones in it.</p>
                  <p>Though ſome will argue from <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32. <hi>They ſpake unto him the Word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe.</hi> It may mean no more, than that they preached to all in the houſe, that were <hi>capable of hearing</hi> the Word taught.

This will not prove, that there were no <hi>little ones</hi> of his houſhold with him. And yet further, they might be ſaid to ſpeak to all that were in the houſe <hi>in a ſence,</hi> to which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not a ſtranger, the Jailour being bound to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Further as touching the Jailour, it is thus in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thus I hope ſufficient Scripture warrant hath been produced for Infant-baptiſm. Many things I have praetermitted, becauſe I would cut this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as ſhort, as I well may. Yet before I paſs from this point, I ſhall take notice of the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made againſt it, becauſe it may tend to your further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We have neither <hi>expreſs Precept</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> in Scripture for the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A <hi>virtual Command</hi> there is in the Goſpel for Baptizing of Infants. The Infants of diſcipled Nations ought to be baptized, as appears from what hath been ſaid. It is implyed in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Now a virtual Command
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:152819:213"/>is equivalent to an <hi>expreſs command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> (the moſt learned Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Anabaptiſts have) grants <hi>Baptiſm in uſe,</hi> even before <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> time, in the admiſſion of Proſelytes, the New Teſtament mentioning <hi>whole houſholds</hi> that were baptized (never excepting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, or little ones) we have reaſon to think, that as the Children of the Proſelytes were baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo the children of the Chriſtians were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed too.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What expreſs Precept or Example can the Objectors ſhew for <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates</hi> in the New Teſtament? And muſt all Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates therefore be diſcarded? Again, what expreſs Precept for the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath?</hi> Whereupon ſome Anabaptiſts have returned to the Jewiſh Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday-Sabbath. Again, what expreſs Precept for Womens receiving the Lords Supper? In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. it is, <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf?</hi> Where though the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Word that follows, is of the Maſculine gender, it is <hi>himſelf,</hi> not <hi>her ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, to ſpeak <hi>ad hominem,</hi> let one that objects againſt us the want of expreſs Precept and Example for <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> ſhew us, where he finds any ſuch Precept or Example for the <hi>ſe-Baptiſts,</hi> that perſons unbaptized ſhould baptize themſelves, as they do in the firſt ſetting up of their way.</p>
                  <p>Again, where do they find either Precept, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all the New Teſtament for Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their <hi>childrens Baptiſm,</hi> till they come to an adult age? Thus the Objection falleth ſoul upon themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:152819:214"/>
                  <p>Certainly, there is a <hi>total ſilence</hi> in Scripture concerning the Children of thoſe that were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not one tittle there of any <hi>Chriſtians child</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Baptiſm delayed, till it came alſo to make a perſonal profeſſion. No doubt but many of thoſe who were converted to the Chriſtian Faith by the Apoſtles, had <hi>little ones,</hi> who either were baptized upon their Parents embracing the Faith, or it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known <hi>at what age</hi> any of them were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and conſequently we cannot tell at what age the Children of Believers now are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                  <p>Now certainly, this is a <hi>weighty</hi> Caſe, and I wiſh that they who ſeem ſo deſirous to keep cloſe to <hi>Scripture-Rule,</hi> would ſeriouſly conſider it. They that are only for the baptizing of <hi>adult</hi> perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a Scripture-Inſtance of <hi>one child born of believing Parents,</hi> whoſe baptiſm was deferred till it came to be adult. And beſides, this would croſs another Rule, that all who are <hi>diſcipled,</hi> as ſoon as they are diſcipled, are to be <hi>baptized.</hi> It is true, that they and we differ concerning the Subject, who are diſcipled; we holding that the Infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are <hi>diſcipled,</hi> (belonging to the Church, the School of Chriſt, and the Parents being bound by the Covenant to train them up in <hi>the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and they bound to receive Inſtruction, as they come to be of any capacity;) but our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites holding none to be <hi>diſcipled,</hi> till they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Principles of Chriſtianity, and make a perſonal Profeſſion. Now ſuppoſe that they were <hi>in the right</hi> here, that none were Diſcipled, and to be baptized but upon a perſonal Profeſſion; yet ſince it is evident, both from <hi>Chriſts commiſſion,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:152819:214"/>Matth.</hi> 28. and from all thoſe <hi>Examples</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptized, upon Record in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as ſoon as any are diſcipled, they are <hi>preſently</hi> to be <hi>baptized.</hi> I would fain know how they either do, or can follow Scripture-Rule in baptizing the Children of Chriſtian Parents, many years (it may be) after they were Diſciples in their own ſence; that is, made a <hi>perſonal profeſſion.</hi> We could give many Inſtances of little Children, who have been Religiouſly Educated, Children of Five or <hi>Six years age,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Mr.</hi> Whites <hi>little Book for little Children.</hi>
                     </note> that have not only made a profeſſion, but given great Signs and <hi>Evidences</hi> of Grace. And ſhould not ſuch be owned as Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And then why not other Children of that age that can give as <hi>good an account,</hi> as may be expected from thoſe Years? And did not Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles admit all to Baptiſm, who made but the leaſt <hi>viſible profeſſion?</hi> Where do we find any rejected? If now they will not admit perſons upon making the leaſt <hi>viſible profeſſion,</hi> but Demur them, till they have arrived a <hi>Degree higher;</hi> why may they not defer their baptiſm, till they are got one degree higher than that, and ſo <hi>in Infinitum?</hi> And how will they obſerve Scripture-rule, which is clearly for the baptizing of perſons, as ſoon as they become Diſciples? If I was of <hi>their Opinion,</hi> that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of the Infants of profeſſed Chriſtians, was againſt Rule, and a Nullity; I muſt ſeriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, I ſhould be <hi>altogether at a loſs,</hi> and not know when to baptize the Children of ſuch. If they muſt be baptized ſo ſoon as they make a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I would fain be informed from Scripture, at what age they may make ſuch a viſible profeſſion,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:152819:215"/>which ought to be taken for their <hi>admiſſion to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this further, whereas thoſe whom they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize, were many of them <hi>Religiouſly Educated,</hi> and ſeemed to have a love to Religion from their Childhood, and were acquainting themſelves with the principles of Religion; I would fain know, whether they will ſay they only <hi>began to make a profeſſion,</hi> when they firſt owned Anabaptiſm?

And then I ask, From what time, for how long they are to charge this ſinful Omiſſion upon themſelves?</p>
                  <p>Now compare their way, and ours, and Judge Impartially, which is moſt agreeable to <hi>Scripture-Rule.</hi> VVe are not for the baptizing of Heathens, or any without the Church, without their having the <hi>Goſpel firſt Preached</hi> to them, and their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to believe it. Now when they receive the Goſpel, they receive it not only for themſelves, but for their Children; and were bound to Inſtruct, and Educate their Children according to it. And ſo ſuch Families were Diſcipled, and to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and what Children they might have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be baptized, as all of them belonging to the Church, and <hi>School of Chriſt,</hi> to be Trained up in the Knowledge of Chriſt. And ſo all along God had <hi>put a Diſtinction</hi> betwixt the Seed of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, and the Children of ſuch as were without the Church: Not only the <hi>Natural ſeed</hi>
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:152819:215"/>of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the Seed of the Proſelytes, that joyned themſelves to the Lord, had the Sign of the Covenant. Thus the way is clear to us, whom, and when to baptize.</p>
                  <p>Our Oppoſites are not for the baptizing of the Children of Chriſtians, but upon their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal profeſſion. Now that baptiſm is not <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be deferred,</hi> after one comes to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they muſt grant. But how ſoon, or how long before a <hi>Childs profeſſion,</hi> is to be accounted ſuch, as entitleth him to baptiſm; they cannot ſhew from any Command, or Example in the VVord. Here they have <hi>no Rule,</hi> as much as they ſeem to be for keeping cloſe to Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>Now think of it ſeriouſly, whether it be at all Credible, that if God would not have the Children of Chriſtians baptized, but upon their <hi>firſt making</hi> a viſible profeſſion, there ſhould yet be no Rule, or Direction, when that might be. VVe can <hi>eaſily diſcern,</hi> when ſuch as were Heathens come firſt to a profeſſion of Chriſtianity: but when a Child of Chriſtian Parents that hath been Learning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity from his very Infancy, I ſay, when ſuch a Child ſhall be taken firſt to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal profeſſion, is no eaſie matter to determine. Now when the moſt that they baptize, are ſuch, as they cannot ſay, when they <hi>firſt came</hi> to make a perſonal profeſſion, let any that are Impartial judge, how well they follow Scripture-Rule. Beſides, ſince they muſt hold, that to baptize a Child before its making a perſonal profeſſion, would make ſuch baptiſm a <hi>Nullity;</hi> and to defer to baptize it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has come to make a perſonal profeſſion, is a <hi>ſinful neglect,</hi> and plain breach of Goſpel-Rule,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:152819:216"/>and Order; and one man may take that for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal proſeſſion, which another would not admit to be ſo: Hereupon it muſt needs follow, that their way layeth a <hi>certain ground</hi> of Claſhing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the Church, and tends to lead both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Chriſtians into endleſs perplexities, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt admiſſion of our Children.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee in this firſt <hi>grand Objection,</hi> that we have neither expreſs Precept, nor Example for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm; they are like a man that <hi>rolleth a ſtone, which returneth upon him</hi> that rolleth it. The Objection returns, and falls heavily on themſelves. There is no need of an <hi>expreſs Precept,</hi> or Example for the baptizing of Infants born within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, this being ſuitable to the <hi>Scripture-way</hi> before, (as from the time that God had appointed an Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Seal of the Covenant, the Infants of Parents within the Covenant, were ever before admitted to the <hi>Initiating Seal</hi> with their Parents.) But there is need of expreſs Direction, Rule, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if ſuch Children are not to be admitted now, but upon their <hi>perſonal profeſſion,</hi> to ſhew, when ſuch profeſſion hath been, or may be taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But further they will Object, that they can ſhew both Precept and Examples againſt Infant-baptiſm.</p>

Precept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> They muſt be Taught before they are to be baptized: To which agrees, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> A Rule for believers baptiſm.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As Learning, and <hi>believing</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Diſpenſation) was required of <hi>adult
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:152819:216"/>perſons</hi> at the firſt Inſtitution of Circumciſion. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſervants that were to be Circumciſed, as well as he, were ſuch as he had <hi>Taught the way</hi> of the Lord, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. And afterwards none could be Proſelytes of the Covenant, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> none that were of years, but they muſt firſt know, and acknowledge the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yet all this hindred not the Circumciſing of their Infants. So in <hi>conſtituting the Goſpel-Church,</hi> they that were of Years, muſt firſt know, and profeſs the Name of Chriſt, before they could be admitted as Members of the Church, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Chriſtians. But this hinders not, but that the Parents being Diſcipled, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to be acknowledged, as belonging to the Church with their Parents. At the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſm, and firſt Conſtituting of the Goſpel-Church; it was neceſſary indeed that the firſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and firſt Subjects of Baptiſm, were taught and brought to profeſs the Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized, (the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtrangers to the Covenant, and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to this new Diſpenſation of it, and none have <hi>right to Baptiſm,</hi> the Initiating Seal of the Goſpel-Covenant, till they come within the Goſpel-Covenant.) And therefore Infants could not be the <hi>firſt Subjects</hi> of Baptiſm, becauſe it was neceſſary their Parents ſhould be in Covenant, to bring them within the Covenant; ſo the Parents ſhould be firſt Baptized, as their right to Baptiſm in <hi>order of Nature,</hi> preceded the right of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But becauſe the Parents were not admitted to Baptiſm, but upon their being Taught, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a perſonal profeſſion, (which was neceſſary to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:152819:217"/>bring them <hi>within the Covenant</hi>) it will not follow that their Children muſt be firſt Taught, and make a perſonal profeſſion before they may be baptized. Theſe being now <hi>in Covenant</hi> together with their Parents, have alſo a right to the Initiating Seal of the Covenant, as well as their Parents. Thus the Baptiſm of ſuch adult perſons, and of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is but one, and the Ground or Reaſon of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing both, is one and the ſame; to wit, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into Covenant. Only the <hi>way of adult</hi> perſons being taken into Covenant, is diverſe from that of their Infants. When perſons come to make a profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, they are taken (at leaſt, Externally) into Covenant, though they were not <hi>born of believing</hi> Parents; and ſuch as are the Children of believing Parents are (at leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally) in the Covenant, though they are not at preſent, capable of being Taught, or of making a perſonal profeſſion.

                     <hi>Baxter</hi> urgeth from <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10.

It plainly appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 5, 24. that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was the <hi>Yoke</hi> there ſpoken of. And it is out of queſtion, that there were more young Children than adult perſons, upon whom thoſe falſe Teachers would have brought this <hi>Yoke.</hi> And ſince this Scripture only declares againſt their lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples, it follows, that either the Children, and Infants of Diſciples are included in this term <hi>[Diſciples]</hi> or that the Circumciſing of ſuch was not forbidden here; but only the Impoſing of Circumciſion upon adult perſons.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhould it ſeem ſtrange, that Children, Infants, are called Diſciples, being admitted into the <hi>School of Chriſt,</hi> and to be Trained up in the Knowledge of Chriſt. Sometimes we ſend our Children to School, before they can <hi>Learn of a book,</hi> and ſuch are numbered among the Scholars, being deſigned for Learning, as ſoon as they are capable.

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:152819:218"/>manner how it was wrought: Scholars are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a School, not becauſe they are already Taught, but that they may be Taught. And <hi>Timothy</hi> was Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures <gap reason="foreign">

The things of God cannot be <hi>Learnt too ſoon,</hi> neither are little Children uncapable Subjects of Divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Grace. But that Chriſtian Parents are bound to <hi>Inſtruct</hi> their Children in the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, and to Teach them their Duty, as ſoon as ever they are capable of receiving ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that Children ought to attend to ſuch Inſtruction; Would not this imply that they are <hi>Diſciples?</hi> But indeed they that are againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Diſcipleſhip and baptiſm, have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Inſtructing and Catechizing of Little ones.

                  <p>Yet further, Is it not as ſtrange, that little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Infants, ſhould be called <hi>Servants,</hi> as that they ſhould be called <hi>Diſciples?</hi> Yet ſuch are called <hi>Servants, Lev.</hi> 25.41, 42.

                  <p>Now I come to conſider that other Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. which ſome I know build moſt upon. <hi>[He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.]</hi> The Scope whereof is to ſhew, who alone partake of the ſaving benefit of baptiſm, (and other Goſpel-Ordinances) <hi>being adult.</hi>

But that there is <hi>no colour</hi> for making this Text the Rule of baptizing; or for any to ſuppoſe, that it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth who are the <hi>only lawful Subjects</hi> of baptiſm; is evident (I think) from theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1, That it is not ſaid, <hi>[He that believeth only, ſhall be baptized.]</hi> But, <hi>[He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.] He that believeth, and is baptized,</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> in this Propoſition, of whom this is predicated, that <hi>[He ſhall be ſaved.]</hi> Hence it is manifeſt, that theſe words hold forth the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Salvation, not the ſubject of <hi>baptiſm.</hi> Yet we muſt not ſay, they determine the <hi>only ſubject
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:152819:219"/>of Salvation,</hi> unleſs we will hold baptiſm of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to Salvation, and hold that no Infant (that does not actually believe) can be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in the Oppoſite Member, it is not ſaid, [He that believeth not, ſhall not be baptized.] but, [He that believeth not, ſhall be damned.]</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If this Text ſhould be taken to determine the <hi>only lawful Subjects</hi> of baptiſm, then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Apoſtles, and their aſſiſtants, were guilty of <hi>Male-adminiſtration,</hi> and Erred in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing many, (ſuch as <hi>Annanias, Saphira, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c.) who were not <hi>believers,</hi> in the ſence of this Text: Either ſuch had a right to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance, or not. If they had <hi>no right</hi> to it, then it was amiſs for any (were they Apoſtles themſelves) to admit them to baptiſm, who had <hi>no right</hi> to it. If they had a right to the outward Ordinance, then [He that believeth, and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Doth not determine the <hi>only lawful Subject</hi> of baptiſm; diverſe having been rightfully baptized, who were not true believers, ſuch as this Text ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If believers baptiſm, be the only lawful baptiſm (in the ſence that believing is here uſed) then how is it poſſible for any Miniſter to diſpoſe this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Faith? He cannot baptize others but <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,</hi> of whoſe unfeigned Faith, he is not aſſured. And he cannot be aſſured, that anothers Faith is true and ſaving, without <hi>Special Revelation.</hi> And thus without Special Revelation he ſhould not know who may lawfully be baptized.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If this Text concludes againſt Infants baptiſm, it concludes as well againſt the <hi>Salvation of Infants.</hi>
                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:152819:219"/>If you ſay, They believe not, and therefore are not to be baptized; it followeth <hi>more directly</hi> from the next words, They believe not, therefore they ſhall be Damned. If now to avoid ſo <hi>horrid a conſquence,</hi> as that all Infants are Damned, you will have the Text Reſtrained to the adult, as needs it muſt be; you take away the force of the Argument hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Baptizing of Infants.</hi> As more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of adult perſons, than of Infants, <hi>in order to Salvation;</hi> So that may be required in order to the baptizing of the adult, which is not required of Infants. And yet I muſt mind you, that this Scripture does not determine, who only of the adult ought to be baptized; but who only of the adult enjoy the ſaving benefit of that, as of other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ordinances. Other things I paſs by for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity-ſake.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) They bring diverſe Examples as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, againſt Infant-baptiſm. As the Example of the Three Thouſands, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 41.

                  <p n="2">2. Our reading, that ſuch and ſuch were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized upon the profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, and the like, will not prove, that <hi>ſuch only</hi> were baptized.</p>
                  <p>The profeſſion of Faith and Repentance might
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:152819:220"/>well be required of adult perſons <hi>in order to baptiſm,</hi> and yet the Children of ſuch as made a profeſſion, be baptized without it. As God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk before him in ſincerity, <hi>[Walk before me, and be thou perfect.

                     <q>How the Holy Ghoſt doth <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry his manner of Expreſſion</hi> here, when he ſpeaks of the baptiſm of Houſholds; he tells us, the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds were baptized together with their Parents; not giving the <hi>leaſt Intimation</hi> of the Faith of any beſides, in, or of thoſe Houſes, as the ground of their Baptiſm, but when he ſpeaks of more <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſemblies,</hi> or Concourſes of People; he ſpeaks more Diſtinguiſhingly: [<hi>As many as gladly received the Word, were baptized,</hi> Acts 2.41.]</q> And why the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſpeak ſo <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhingly</hi> in one place, and not in the other, is hard to ſay; unleſs it ſhould be, becauſe in reſpect of ſuch more General Aſſemblies, and Concourſes of People, conſiſting of Grown Perſons; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Faith of each was neceſſary to their Baptiſm, but not ſo in reſpect of the Houſes of believing Parents.</p>
                  <p>Further, Some urge the Example of Chriſt, who was not Baptized till he was Thirty Years Old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What? Would they have had him
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:152819:221"/>baptized, before <hi>John</hi> was ſent, or had authority to baptize?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How well do they <hi>follow Chriſts</hi> Example, who are for baptizing perſons at half Thirty Years Age?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the reaſon of Chriſts not being Baptized till he was about Thirty Years old, could not be to Teach that none are to be <hi>admitted to baptiſm,</hi> till they can make a perſonal profeſſion. Certainly, Chriſt had for a long time before, made a Perſonal profeſſion. He being a Child was filled with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Grace of God was upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40. And when he was but <hi>Twelve Years Old,</hi> he was able to Diſpute with the moſt Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to the aſtoniſhing of all that heard him, <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 46, 47.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Example, that Chriſt went to <hi>John</hi> to be Baptized of him, rather makes againſt their <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi> And the firſt of their way, baptize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Surely, they cannot plead Chriſts Example for this Practice.</p>
                  <p>So, ſome urge the Example of the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 6.3. Of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3.27. Of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, Col.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is certain, all the baptized <hi>Romans, Galatians, Coloſſians,</hi> had not Savingly and Really put on Chriſt, neither were Really buried with Chriſt; but only <hi>Sacramentally</hi> many of them. And thus in infant-baptiſm there is a putting on Chriſt, and a being buried with Chriſt; ſome being <hi>really Ingrafted</hi> into him, and really partaking of the Fruits of his Death; and all being under an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as they ſhall grow up, to put on Chriſt, and to Conform themſelves to the Death, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:152819:221"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Another great Objection againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, is that it Fruſtrates the ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is Unprofitable and Vain; Infants being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Underſtanding, or Improving it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here that is a ſure Rule,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inſtit.</hi> l. 4. c. 16. ſect. 20.</note> which <hi>Calvin</hi> lays down: <hi>Quaecunque ad qualifaciendam Circumciſionem ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenta inclinant, vim nullam habent in oppugnando Baptiſmo.</hi> Thoſe arguments which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Infant-Circumciſion, (which was an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ordinance of God) cannot be Valid againſt Infant-baptiſm. There were <hi>Spiritual, and Holy ends of</hi> Circumciſion, and adult perſons were to make that uſe of their Circumciſion, which an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant could not make of it. Now ſhall any hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deny, that the <hi>Circumciſion of Infants</hi> was an Ordinance of God, or deny the Wiſdom of God in appointing it? Since it is Obvious, that what is Objected here againſt Infant-baptiſm, may as well be turned againſt Infant-Circumciſion: May we not ſay, to any ſuch Objector, as the Apoſtle (in another ſence) <hi>Nay but, O man, who art thou that diſputeſt againſt God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of all thoſe Seven ends of Baptiſm, which <hi>H. D.</hi> lays down: I would fain know which, or how many of them agreed unto Chriſts own bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Was his baptiſm to witneſs his Repentance, who had no ſin to repent of? Or was it to evidence his preſent Regeneration, who was Gods holy One from the birth, and from the Conception? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Did all thoſe Ends agree to the baptiſm of <hi>Simon Magus, &amp;c.</hi> Did the baptiſm of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> witneſs his Repentance, and Evidence his preſent Regeneratian? Or declare his being buried with Chriſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:152819:222"/>4. Since baptiſm is acknowledged a Sign of Gods Covenant, and of entrance into the Church, and the Infant-Children of believers are within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and of the Church (as hath been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved) in theſe reſpects baptiſm doth belong to ſuch Infants, as well as it would to others adult, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their embracing the Chriſtian Faith, and making a profeſſion. Where the ſame thing hath ſeveral reſpects, it may agree to one in one reſpect, and to others in other reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of ſin (which is the Inward Baptiſm) are things that Infants are not uncapable of, if they be not uncapable of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Why then ſhould they be thought uncapable of the Outward baptiſm, the Sign thereof?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Fruit, and benefit of this Ordinance of baptiſm, is not reſtrained to the very <hi>Time</hi> of the Adminiſtration of it; but may come in afterwards. Yea, that baptiſm received in Infancy, is of uſe through ones whole courſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yea, in ſome reſpects it hath its ſpecial uſes and advantages, even above that in adult Eſtate. To name a few particulars here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As the Child baptized is a <hi>declared Member</hi> of the Viſible Church of Chriſt, and ſo eſpecially Intereſted
<note n="*" place="margin">I mean, above others who are yet without the Church.</note> in the Churches Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, even <hi>before it can</hi> pray for it ſelf. Certainly, to have a ſhare in the Prayers of all Gods People, is no mean Priviledge. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham prayed for Iſhmael,</hi> though he was not the Son of the Promiſe; yet, <hi>As for Iſhmael, I have heard thee,</hi> (ſays God, Gen. 17.20.) <hi>Behold, I have bleſſed him, and will make him Fruitful.</hi> That he
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:152819:222"/>fared ſome way better for <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer. Though the Church of God out of <hi>common Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> prays for all men; yet more eſpecially for her Members, for whom ſhe can plead Gods Covenant. And thus Infants by their baptiſm being declared Members of the Church, and within the Covenant, are in a greater probability of <hi>reaping benefit</hi> by the Prayers of Gods People, than if they are ſuppoſed to be without the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe upon our Principles, Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have <hi>ſtronger Pleas</hi> to urge with God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on the behalf of their Children, than they of contrary Principles can have. They can pray for their Children, only as they may <hi>pray for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> while they ſuppoſe them out of the Covenant. Now ſee the difference of theſe two States, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.19. <hi>We are thine,— they are not called by thy Name.</hi> So we can pray for our Children upon better grounds, Lord, bleſs them, own them, <hi>they are thine.</hi> When our Oppoſites deny themſelves this Plea, and inſtead of it muſt pray God to pity them, though <hi>they are not called by his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infant-baptiſm lays a <hi>ſtronger</hi> Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Parents to bring up their Children in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Nurture, and Admonition of the Lord. And how many have cauſe to bleſs God for the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of</hi> good Education? And how ſtrong a Motive is this, to Excite and Quicken Godly Parents to their Duty, in the Religious Education of their Children, to conſider Gods ſpecial Intereſt in them, their ſolemn devoting of them to his Service, and ſolemn promiſe to Train them up for him?</p>
                  <p>Yea, many from the meer workings of Natural Conſcience, hereupon have ſhewn ſome Care, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:152819:223"/>their Children might be Inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, whereby the Knowledge of Chriſt and Chriſtianity, is further ſpread.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Infant-baptiſm alſo lays a ſpecial <hi>Obligation</hi> upon Children, to acquaint themſelves with the Terms, and Tenour of that Covenant, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have engaged them in. And ſo it is a <hi>ſpecial means</hi> to continue the Covenant-Relation betwixt God, and his Peoples Seed. Parents being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obliged to <hi>Catechiſe,</hi> Inſtruct Children, and Teach them their Duty, and to bring them to the Means, the Word and Ordinances of Chriſt; and <hi>Children being obliged</hi> to receive ſuch Inſtructions, and to attend upon the Word, and Ordinances, and apply themſelves to the Service of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have been Devoted. And herein Gods <hi>preventing Love</hi> and Mercy towards our Children is ſeen, that he would not have them <hi>left to their own choice,</hi> whom they would ſerve, any more than the Seed of his People of Old; and that as they could never have choſen better for themſelves, ſo the ſence of their <hi>baptiſmal Covenant</hi> might prevail with them, as ſoon as they come to any underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will of their own, to ſerve the <hi>God of their Fathers;</hi> to ſet forward in the good and right Way, wherein they ſhould go, betimes before they are ſinfully Habituated in any other Courſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Infant-baptiſm carrieth in it the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our miſerable, ſinful, and corrupt Eſtate <hi>by Nature,</hi> and of the need there is (in reſpect of Original corruption) both of the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> to take off the Guilt, and of the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> to free our ſouls from the power of Corruption. And thus it hath a <hi>direct tendency</hi> towards a deep
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:152819:223"/>Humiliation, and ſound Converſion, as ſoon as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are of Capacity to reflect upon it. If bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was <hi>only Adminiſtred</hi> to perſons of adult age, though it denotes thus much, that they are ſinful, unclean Creatures (conſidered in themſelves) ſuch as <hi>have need of waſhing;</hi> yet it would not point at Original Corruption, as Infant-baptiſm doth; for they might be accounted <hi>ſinners by practice,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being acknowledged <hi>ſinful by Nature.</hi> As we know, many who have been againſt Infant-baptiſm, have denied Original ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Infant-baptiſm is a more viſible Character, and Expreſſion of Gods <hi>Free-grace,</hi> the ſubject being <hi>purely paſſive.</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange, that God ſhould this way hold forth his Free-Grace under the Old Teſtament, providing an Ordinance of which Infants were capable, and make no ſuch proviſion under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Infant-baptiſm engageth us againſt ſin, as a <hi>vowed Enemy</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to have War with <hi>Amalek</hi> for ever: So are we ever to reſolve, and ſtrive againſt ſin, and ſeek the utter Extirpation of it. That we were falſe to Chriſt, and lived in <hi>the Violation</hi> of our Baptiſmal Covenant, all that while we ſerved ſin: The remembrance and conſideration thereof, is a <hi>means to further the Humiliation</hi> of many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts for ſins paſt, as a means to quicken them to greater watchfulneſs and reſolvedneſs againſt ſin for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>Here methinks it is worth noticing, what one ſays,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ep. Ded. to Mr.</hi> Fords <hi>practical uſe of Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> p. 5.</note> 
                     <q>Though it may in ſome caſes be granted, that an Ordinance adminiſtred
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:152819:224"/>with ſome conſiderable circumſtantial <hi>Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> may ſanctifie; yet that thoſe Irregularities themſelves ſhould be the <hi>Channels</hi> of Sanctifying Grace, it is not eaſily imaginable. Now this is the caſe of Infant-baptiſm. Many holy men of many Ages, have found their hearts Warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Quickned in the Exerciſe of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Love, Thankfulneſs, reſtrained from ſin, excited to duty, by the conſideration (not only of Baptiſm, and the Perſonal Covenant therein Sealed, but alſo) of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Circumſtance, and the Covenant of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, the Foundation of that Adminiſtration.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Infant-baptiſm affords much Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to believing Parents, in reference to their ſeed. It may well rejoyce the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parent, to ſee his Childes baptiſm a <hi>token of Gods good Will</hi> towards it, Sealing his Covenant with it. And take away the grounds of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and what ground hath a Believer to hope of the ſalvation of his Child dying in Infancy, more than to hope of the ſalvation of the Child of any Heathen or Infidel? Infants are not ſaved upon account of <hi>Native Innocency,</hi> (though they are innocent in reſpect of Actual Tranſgreſſion, yet are they Guilty in reſpect of Natural <hi>inherent Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)</hi> but Infants that are ſaved, are ſaved upon the account of Chriſt: And if ſaved by Chriſt, then Intereſted in him: And if Intereſted in him, by what Covenant? I know no other but that, where God promiſeth to be the God of a Believer, and of his ſeed, that can <hi>give us hopes</hi> of the ſalvation of our Children, dying in Infancy. No other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that I can find in Scripture, to make over Chriſt and his ſaving Benefits to Infants.</p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:152819:224"/>
                  <p>But now God promiſing to be a God to the ſeed of believers, and ſealing this in their Baptiſm, ſuch of them as die Infants, and ſo no ways revoke or <hi>violate the</hi> Covenant by any Act or Deed of theirs, we have good ground to conclude that they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Theſe being in Covenant, and not breaking Covenant with God, it is not to be thought, that God will break Covenant with them.</p>
                  <p>Again, hence godly Parents may be encouraged, in reference to their living Iſſue. Since God hath taken them into Covenant, there is <hi>more hope,</hi> that God may have ſpecial Covenant-bleſſings in ſtore for them, than there is of ſuch as are out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And if Parents and Children were Diligent, and Faithful in doing their part, we might ſee then, it ſhould not ſtick at Him, the Lord would not fail to do His part. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Infant-baptiſm (engaging the ſeed of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſtians to the embracing and profeſſing of Chriſtianity) hath been one great means to enlarge the Viſible Church, and Kingdom of Chriſt. A means to <hi>preſerve</hi> the Chriſtian Religion, and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate</hi> it to many, that otherwiſe were likely never to have come ſo far, as to an outward owning and profeſſion of it. It is not ſo eaſie to draw perſons <hi>to a renouncing of Chriſt</hi> and Chriſtianity, who have been engaged to a Profeſſion of it from their very Infancy; as it would have been to have kept many ſuch <hi>from owning</hi> it at all, had they been left to themſelves, till they were grown up, then to chuſe for themſelves. I hope, there are none of us, ſo ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as not to acknowledge it <hi>a priviledge,</hi> to live in a Land, where Chriſt is generally owned by an
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:152819:225"/>open, outward profeſſion; rather than to Live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> that are Enemies to the very Name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee more of this Nature in Mr. <hi>Fords,</hi> practical Uſe of Infant-baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. They Object, that Infant-baptiſm is followed with Miſchiefs, attended with very evil Conſequences; bringing in falſe Matter into the Church, and Deforming her with ſo many Rotten Members, Ignorant, and Scandalous Perſons, as many of thoſe prove, who were Baptized in Infancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They might with as good Reaſon bring in the like Charge againſt Infant-Circumciſion. Now would not that be to charge <hi>God fooliſhly?</hi> And ſhall <hi>a man be more pure than his Maker?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Were there no Rotten Members among all thoſe whom <hi>John</hi> Baptized? <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. No Rotten Members among them of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Baptized by <hi>Phillip? Acts</hi> 8. No Rotten Members in the Church of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and other Churches, we read of planted by the Apoſtles themſelves?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Are there no Rotten Members that they take in? No Hypocrites? None of corrupt Principles?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> is neither a cauſe of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor of Profaneneſs, but <hi>an Engagement</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that have been partakers of it, to Learn the Doctrine of Chriſt, and live according to his Laws. And however Infants may prove afterwards, yet when they are admitted to Baptiſm, they are free from all culpable Ignorance, not guilty of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, nor to be charged with any Actual ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The true cauſe of theſe Miſchiefs is <hi>Parents neglect</hi> of their Duty, of Inſtructing and Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Children as they ought; or want of the due
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:152819:225"/>Exerciſe of <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> and Cenſures. And ſo they might be prevented, or removed by other wayes and means, than denying Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>And if any that are Parents think they have done enough, in having brought their Children to be Baptized; or any Perſon thinks, he is a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, becauſe he is baptized, they have not Learnt ſo of us.</p>
                  <p>More I would have ſaid to this, becauſe it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with ſome well-meaning Souls; but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refer you to what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath written of Infant-baptiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 117. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. They Object, that Baptiſm being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to one in Infancy, he hath no way to be certain, that he was Baptized, but muſt take it upon truſt from others. And in this reſpect there is more to be ſaid for Infant-Circumciſion, becauſe that left a Mark and Character, whereby it might be known, ſuch were Circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Circumciſion was uſed amongſt others, beſides the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſome that were Idolaters, and Heathens, took up this Rite; though to them it was not the Ordinance of Circumciſion, or a Sign of Gods Covenant. And it was poſſible for the <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſometimes taken Captive by theſe, and their Children to be Circumciſed with their Mock-Circumciſion. Now look how the <hi>Jews</hi> might be ſatisfied, that they had the true Circumciſion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n the like way our Children may be certified of their Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How was <hi>Paul</hi> certified, that he was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>the eighth day,</hi> Phil. 3.5. Surely, he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:152819:226"/>And the ſame way may our Children be certified of their Baptiſm in Infancy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What aſſurance can they that are Rebaptized have, that their later baptiſm was right? I ſuppoſe the words <hi>[I baptize thee in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,]</hi> are pronounced as they are Plunging into the Water; at which time it is not poſſible they ſhould hear, and attend to them. How do they know <hi>in whoſe Name they were baptized?</hi> Muſt not they alſo take it upon truſt, that they were Baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which the By-ſtanders ſometimes could not hear diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Why may we not as well be certified of our Baptiſm in Infancy by a Regiſter, as of our Birth?

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:152819:226"/>if thoſe antient Hereticks could have found any fair pretence from Antiquity to have oppoſed Infant-baptiſm, ſince it would have made ſo much for their purpoſe, they would have thought their Labour here well beſtowed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Laſt, One Objection more, that muſt not be paſſed by, is, That we have changed the <hi>antient Rite</hi> and Ceremony of <hi>Dipping.</hi> This ſome make ſo Eſſential and Neceſſary to true Baptiſm, that they hold our Baptiſm no more Baptiſm, than it would have been Circumciſion; if inſtead of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Foreskin, they had only pared their Nails.</p>
                  <p>Now, 1. They argue for the Neceſſity of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, from the Notation of the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which they will have only to ſignifie Dipping, or Plunging into Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if it could be proved that the word <hi>[Baptize]</hi> primarily ſignifieth to <hi>Dip,</hi> Plunge, or Cover all over; yet the Scripture-uſe of the word is againſt them. This is plain from Many Texts which are ordinarily produced, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they waſh <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, They Eat not. I hope they do not Imagine, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Dipt themſelves every time they went to Meat. So the word is uſed to ſignifie any way of Waſhing, and not only that of Dipping. And whereas they uſe to oppoſe <hi>[Baptizing]</hi> to Rantizing, or <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> yet the Scripture uſeth them promiſcuouſly: In the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Sprinkling</hi> is ſometimes called <hi>Baptiſm, Heb.</hi> 9.10. We read of diverſe Waſhings, in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <hi>Baptiſmes.</hi> Where ſome of thoſe Waſhings ſpoken of, were by way of <hi>Sprinkling, ver.</hi> 13, 19, 21. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.7.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:152819:227"/>and 19.17, 18. And whether is more proper to the place, diverſe kinds of Dipping, or diverſe kinds of Waſhing and Purifying?</p>

                     </gap>, he went up <hi>[from]</hi> not <hi>[out of]</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Another Text which they think very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their purpoſe, is <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>John</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Aenon,</hi>

                     </gap>, becauſe many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were there. The Text proves not the waters of ſuch depth, as was convenient for Dipping; though here was a conveniency, when great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes came to <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, that he and his Diſciples might be employed together. The word <hi>Aenon</hi> ſignifies no more than <hi>Fonticulus,</hi> a little Spring, or Rivulet. And they tell us, it was a ſmall Brook indeed, which one might almoſt ſtride over; though of no ſmall account in that hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where water was ſo ſcarce. Another Text they ſtand much upon, is <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. which if it will prove, that <hi>Phillip</hi> Dipped the Eunuch, it will prove alſo that he Dipped himſelf: For it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. They have little to ſay, to thoſe Inſtances, which ſome of ours produce of Perſons baptized, and no probability <hi>of their</hi> being Dipt. As we read of Three Thouſand baptized in a day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. Yea, in part of a day. (Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 15. with 41.) VVhen ſo few hands were to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would ſeem paſſing ſtrange, that they ſhould Dip ſo many as Three Thouſand, taking them one by one, in part of a day, (as one part of the day was ſpent before the Company met, and a further part of it was ſpent in <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, by which they were Converted.) Now had they been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>in their way,</hi> it would ſcarce have been the work of a day or two. Again, if they were Dipt, they were either Dipt <hi>Naked,</hi> or in <hi>their Cloaths.</hi> If <hi>Naked,</hi> then they might all have ſeemed <hi>full of new Wine</hi> indeed. If <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when <hi>Hanun</hi> cut off their Garments to the Middle, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.) What <hi>matter of ſhame</hi> had it been, if all theſe had been ſtript Naked? And what reproach would this have brought upon the way of Chriſtianity? If <hi>in their Cloaths,</hi> ſuch Dipping would have been a Waſhing of their Cloaths, rather than of themſelves. So the Cloaths had been baptized <hi>immediately,</hi> and primarily, and the Body only <hi>conſequently,</hi> and ſecondarily. Thus indeed their Bodies might be wet, but not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhed. So likewiſe ſome parts of the body might have been <hi>untouched,</hi> And then how would ſuch Dipping hold forth a being <hi>Sanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, when <hi>Paul</hi> was weak after three dayes Faſting, <hi>Ananias</hi> comes to him in the Houſe of
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:152819:228"/>
                     <hi>Judas,</hi> and baptized him. And afterwards recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Meat he was ſtrengthened, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9, 18, 19. What Evidence or <hi>Probability</hi> can they ſhew, that <hi>Paul</hi> in that weak condition he was in, was taken out to a River, or Plunged into cold water, which might in an ordinary way have deſtroyed him? The old Rule <hi>[I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,]</hi> approved by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.7. may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, that either it was not <hi>Pauls</hi> duty <hi>(pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> to be baptized, or that Plunging the body into water was not then held <hi>indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary,</hi> and eſſential to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Again, we read, the Jailor and his Houſhold were baptized in the Night. Had the Jailor a Pond, or River in his Houſe? Or if he was ſo well ſtored with water laid in, as might ſuffice to Dip or Plung them into; yet would it be <hi>pure enough</hi> for thoſe that came laſt, when others had been waſhed in it before? We know ſometimes they Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from that Expreſſion of <hi>[Bodies waſhed with pure water,]</hi> Heb. 10.22.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Had it been never ſo clear and manifeſt, that in thoſe Hotter Countreys, Baptiſm was Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the <hi>way of Dipping;</hi> there is more to be pleaded for it, than for this Practice in ſuch a cold Climate as ours, where it would be to croſs other Scripture-Rules. As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> conceives, that <q>The Practice ſprung up in the Hotter Countreys, where Cuſtome had Taught them to go almoſt half Naked, in compariſon of us, and therefore it was there more Civil, or leſs Immodeſt, and leſs Dangerous to their Lives.</q> But what he hath written of this Practice in our Circumſtances, <hi>pag.</hi> 134. to 138. deſerves to be well weighed. So far
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:152819:229"/>as I am able to judge, he there clearly proves, that our Dippers <hi>break the Commandment of God,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They argue from the Nature of Baptiſm, and the <hi>Analogy</hi> and Reſemblance betwixt <hi>Dipping,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Burial,</hi> or our burial with Chriſt, held forth in baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. And on this, the wiſeſt of them lay the greateſt ſtreſs: To overthrow this, is to overthrow their greateſt ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whereas one of them makes <hi>Dipping</hi> the <hi>very Form</hi> of Baptiſm: If it were ſo, then (for as much as <hi>Forma dat eſſe rei</hi>) whenſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are Dipt, (as ſome are for <hi>Puniſhment</hi>) or Dip and Douſe themſelves, (as ſome do for <hi>Pleaſure</hi>) this ſhould be the Ordinance of Baptiſm, here being the <hi>true Form</hi> of baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not the <hi>Meaſure</hi> and <hi>Quantity,</hi> but the <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of water, that is Repreſentative, and Significative (by Chriſts Inſtitution) in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I ſhould not dare to make the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dipping,</hi> or <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> or (which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſe) <hi>Pouring on</hi> of water <hi>a Sacramental,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clearer Evidence of Scripture, than I could ever yet ſee produced. As in the Lords Supper, Chriſt hath appointed Bread and VVine, without determining how much of theſe each Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant ſhould take: So in Baptiſm, he hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water to be uſed (to ſignifie the <hi>Cleanſing virtue</hi> and Efficacy of his Blood and Spirit) without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the quantity of water, or the manner how it ſhould be applied, whether by Immerſion, Aſperſion, or Superfuſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If becauſe <hi>Dipping</hi> beſt Repreſenteth the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:152819:229"/>of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore we muſt be for <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> upon any Terms, and account that no Baptiſm, which is not this way Adminiſtred; I doubt this way of Arguing hath a Reach, quite beyond the Intention of them that uſe, and urge it.</p>
                  <p>They that are ſo Zealous for Dipping, to hold forth their <hi>being Buried with Chriſt,</hi> by a parity of Reaſon ſhould as well be for <hi>Croſſing,</hi> to hold forth their being Crucified with Chriſt. VVhereas they Inſiſt ſo much on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſm:</hi> In the two next verſes, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of being Planted together <hi>in the likeneſs of his Death;</hi> and of the Old Man <hi>being Crucified</hi> with him, (<hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.) Now might they not from hence Argue as well for <hi>Croſſing</hi> all that were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as holding forth the <hi>likeneſs of Chriſts Death</hi> more clearly, than Dipping only doth? Only they ſhould be for Croſſing firſt. and Dipping after that; as the Crucifixion and Death of Chriſt preceded his Burial, and as men uſe not to be buried before they are dead. So might not others plead as well for the <hi>White Garment,</hi> as holding forth that Purity and Holineſs Chriſtians are called, and obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? So might they not in like manner Argue for the Miniſters Breaking and Giving to every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant a <hi>whole Loaf,</hi> more clearly to hold forth ſuch an ones duty to <hi>take whole Chriſt,</hi> and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of very worthy Receiver, that he is Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in <hi>whole Chriſt?</hi> And might they not as well contend for every ones <hi>taking their full of Bread and Wine,</hi> in the Lords Supper, to hold forth in a plain and Lively manner, that plentiful Proviſion which is made for Souls in Chriſt; and that one Chriſt is enough to fill us all: According to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:152819:230"/>
                     <hi>Eat, O Friends, Drink, yea, Drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, O Beloved.</hi> By this way of Arguing, might not men ſoon bring into that part of Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip, as great Diſorders as ever were in the Church of <hi>Corinth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe ſhould they not as well plead for the uſe of <hi>Muſical Inſtruments</hi> in ſinging of Pſalmes, as from the proper ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: So from the Nature of the thing, it fitly ſetting forth the <hi>Melody</hi> we ſhould make in our hearts to the Lord, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19)</p>
                  <p>But further, may not others as well Argue for <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> becauſe Baptiſm is to ſignifie the Souls being cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt, which is called the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2. And the Inward Waſhing, which the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm repreſenteth, is ſet forth under the Term of <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> or (as they call it) Ranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. As the ſame thing was ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out under the Law by <hi>Sprinkling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or may one not ſay (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) that <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or <hi>Pouring on</hi> water, where water is applied to the Body, ſets forth in a more lively manner, the Grace of Chriſt in waſhing away our ſins, than <hi>Dipping,</hi> where the Body is applied to the water? That being done rather by <hi>applying Chriſts Blood</hi> to Us, than by applying our ſelves to Chriſts Blood.</p>
                  <p>And may we not as well Argue for Baptizing, by <hi>Pouring on</hi> water (which we generally Practiſe) as beſt ſetting forth the Communication of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, promiſed to be <hi>Poured on</hi> us, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. Certainly they are all one, to be Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and to have the <hi>Spirit poured on</hi> us.</p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:152819:230"/>
                  <p>Thus it is plain, that their Arguing for Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from Alluſion and <hi>Analogy,</hi> hath no ſtrength, or Cogency at all. The ſame Argument may be urged againſt them. As they decry Baptizing by <hi>Sprinkling</hi> (which I think few or none amongſt us uſe) or <hi>Pouring on</hi> water, as not holding forth the Burial of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others have the <hi>like Plea</hi> againſt Dipping, as not holding forth the <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Blood</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>Pouring forth of</hi> his Spirit, which Baptiſm is as well to ſignifie. Let them anſwer here for themſelves, and they will anſwer for us too.</p>
                  <p>Here I ſhall only add this Note, That <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rite</hi> be uſed in Baptiſm, whether theirs, or that which we hold beſt and ſafeſt in our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>being Baptized unto Chriſt;</hi> it muſt needs follow, that we are <hi>Baptized unto his Death,</hi> and obliged to Conformity to him; and to improve Chriſt, to our dying more and more unto ſin, and riſing again to Newneſs of Life. And thus we are <hi>buried with Chriſt</hi> by Baptiſm, Baptiſm ſerving for this Uſe and End, to hold forth our Duty and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge (if Faithful in our Baptiſmal Covenant) of being made Conformable to his Death.</p>
                  <p>As for the Objections againſt Dipping, as they hold it <hi>neceſſary for all Times, and Places,</hi> they are not ſo weak as <hi>H. D.</hi> would make them: Who ſays thus,

                  <p>To the like purpoſe conſult what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 39. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me. And this is the Fathers will, that of all
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:152819:234"/>which he hath given me, I ſhould looſe nothing; but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day. Raiſe it up,</hi> that is, to everlaſting Life, as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 40. Hence it is plain, that in regard of <hi>Gods Will</hi> and Purpoſe, all the Elect ſhall certainly come to Chriſt, and be kept by him to everlaſting Life.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much is implied in that ſpeech of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they would deceive the very Elect.</hi> It is impoſſible that falſe Chriſts ſhould deceive the Elect.

                  <p>And may we not gather as much from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> How will this hold true, and yet they may fall into the greateſt of Evils, both <hi>Sinful,</hi> and <hi>Penal, Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called: And whom he called, them he alſo juſtified: and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> They that can prove their <hi>Election</hi> by their <hi>effectual Vocation,</hi> may thence conclude their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and their future <hi>Glorification.</hi> Though the former of theſe Texts ſhould make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt thoſe, who grant the certain Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Elect as ſuch, but not of all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or Sanctified; (ſuppoſing there are ſome ſuch, who are not Elect) yet this laſt Scripture clearly Determines that all that are called, that is, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called (and ſo Sanctified) and Juſtified, are
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:152819:234"/>or ſhall be Glorified, and Conſequently muſt needs Perſevere.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) What becomes of <hi>Divine Promiſes,</hi> that look this way, if the Faithful do not certainly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere? Is not Gods Promiſe good Security? <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Here we ſee Perſevering-Grace is a <hi>Gift,</hi> which God hath promiſed. And they in whoſe hearts God putteth his Fear, they ſhall fear him <hi>for ever,</hi> (ver. 39.) they ſhall not depart from him. It is Evident, and Undeniable, that this is here promiſed. Now it is promiſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> or <hi>Conditionally.</hi> If abſolutely, then it inevitably follows, that they muſt continue in his Fear, and never depart from Him; Or elſe where were his Truth and Faithfulneſs? If <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> Then what is the Condition? Can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it thus, <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> If there will be to continue to fear me, if their will be not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? But hold: The ſame thing cannot be the <hi>thing promiſed,</hi> and the <hi>condition</hi> unto which it is promiſed. <hi>Otioſa eſt haec conditio, facit enim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverantiam conditionem perſeverantiae: Non enim deeſſe gratiae ſufficienti eſt perſeveraere,</hi> (Suffrag. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. de 5. Art. p. 225.) I hope, they with whom we have to do here, would not make God, <hi>as one that Mocketh.</hi> And then how can this be the ſence, <hi>I will give them to fear me, that they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me: Provided their will</hi> be to fear me ſtill, and their care not to depart from me. I will give them to continue and perſevere in my fear, if their will be to continue in my fear; that is, If they do continue in my fear; Certainly, they that do
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:152819:235"/>perſevere, muſt perſevere, whether God promiſed it, or no. <hi>No need</hi> for God to promiſe that, the contrary whereof would <hi>imply a Contradiction.</hi> VVe neither conſult the Honour of his Wiſdom, nor of his Grace, if we would have no more meant than ſo.</p>
                  <p>And further, If the Lord promiſed no more here, than Grace to perſevere, <hi>if we will;</hi> then there ſhould be no more promiſed to Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> might have concluded on under the <hi>Covenant of Works. Adamo fuit datum, ut poſſet. ſi vellet in bono perſeverare, ſed non fuit datum, ut vellet: Nobis verò, qui verò Chriſto inſiti ſumus, talis data eſt gratia, ut non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum poſſimus, ſi velimus, ſed etiam ut velimus in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto perſeverare,</hi> (Aug. de Correp. &amp; grat. in c. 11. &amp; 12. Ut Suffr. Britan ib.)</p>
                  <p>Yea, the condition of Believers would be ſo much worſe than Innocent <hi>Adams,</hi> by how much they have <hi>leſs ſtrength,</hi> than he had. Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> had the fear of God in his heart, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had not been Innocent) and that <hi>fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> in his heart; muſt needs have <hi>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

VVhereas the beſt of Saints upon Earth are not ſo perfect in Faith, or Fear, or any Grace, but that there is ſomething of a contrary <hi>corrupt principle</hi> ſtill remaining in them, as a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the Faithful ſhould not perſevere, it is

                  <p>Likewiſe that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Kept by the power of God through Faith, unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Where we ſee the Lord hath them in his keeping. And, <hi>Qui cuſtodit nos per fidem, cuſtodit in nobis fidem:</hi> He that keepeth us through Faith unto Salvation, keepeth Faith in us to Salvation. How are they kept <hi>by his power,</hi> who are ſuffered to Apoſtatize, that they are loſt Creatures? (<hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:152819:236"/>17.12.) Surely, ſuch are deſerted and caſt off, <hi>not kept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) VVhat becomes of Chriſts Prayer, and <hi>prevalent Interceſſion,</hi> if Believers ſhall not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere? There is therefore <hi>no Condemnation</hi> to them, becauſe Chriſt is at the Right-hand of God, <hi>making Interceſſion</hi> for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. VVhat is it that Chriſt Sueth and Pleadeth for, on the behalf of his People? That their <hi>Faith may not fail,</hi> as he Prayed for <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.32. That God would keep them through his own Name, keep them from the evil. If they are <hi>not kept</hi> from the evil of <hi>Total and Final</hi> Apoſtacy, How is Chriſts Prayer for them heard? See <hi>John</hi> 17.11, 15, 20. If there be any power in the Interceſſion of Chriſt (whom <hi>the Father heareth always</hi>) Believers ſhall be kept by Gods power. The Father ſhould not <hi>have his will,</hi> if they be not kept unto Salvation, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. Neither ſhould the Son <hi>have his will,</hi> John 17.24.</p>
                  <p>And to ſay, that Chriſt meaneth no more, but that they might be kept, upon condition that they be not <hi>wanting to themſelves;</hi> is as if he ſhould only Pray that they might be kept, while indeed they ſhall keep themſelves. So to deny the <hi>certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance</hi> of the Faithful, is to make Chriſts Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion on that behalf, either <hi>Needleſs,</hi> or <hi>Fruitleſs,</hi> and <hi>Succeſſleſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) VVhat becomes of the Saints prayers for Perſeverance? And what ground have any of us to Pray, that the Lord would <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite our hearts</hi> to fear his Name, that he would give us an heart to fear him for ever; or that we may be <hi>kept by his power,</hi> and ſo guarded with his Grace, that no Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:152819:237"/>may prevail, to draw us away from him? If the Faithful may fall away, and if God doth not <hi>promiſe</hi> their Perſeverance, but <hi>conditionally,</hi> then the meaning of ſuch Petitions can be no more than this: <q>Lord, keep me, ſo long as I have a care to keep my ſelf. Lord, <hi>uphold</hi> me by thy Grace, ſo long as I have a care not to fall. Preſerve me in thy fear, while I have an heart to fear thee. Give me to perſevere, <hi>if I will.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) If the Faithful do not certainly perſevere, what becomes of Gods <hi>everlaſting Love</hi> to them? That Love which the Apoſtle doth ſo greatly glory in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Should he ſuffer them to draw back, his Soul could then <hi>take no more pleaſure</hi> in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Then he ſhould not remember them with everlaſting kindneſs, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8, 10. Or Love them with an everlaſting Love, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3.</p>
                  <p>If any Believer fall away, and periſh, certainly it is not for <hi>want of Power</hi> in God. He that could quicken them, when dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, could <hi>ſettle</hi> them when <hi>Staggering;</hi> could Raiſe them when Fallen. I ſay, it is not for want of Power in God to keep them, if they be not kept: He is <hi>of power to Eſtabliſh</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. He is <hi>able to keep them</hi> from <hi>falling,</hi> Jude ver. 24. He is <hi>able to build them up,</hi> and to give them an Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all them that are Sanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. And otherwiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> would not have prayed, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. That the <hi>God of all Grace would make them Perfect, Eſtabliſh, Strengthen, Settle them.</hi> Nor would Chriſt have Prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>his Faith might not fail;</hi> if it had not been <hi>in his Fathers hands,</hi> to prevent the failing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:152819:237"/>of <hi>Peters</hi> faith. And if it be not for want of Power, it cannot be, that they are not kept for <hi>want of</hi> Love, and good will in God towards them. The Love of God being ſuch, as brought them to the Participation of his Grace, and <hi>Reconciled</hi> them to Himſelf, who before were Enemies; how ſtrange were it, if he ſhould not continue to Love them, whom he hath Reconciled. See how the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10, 17.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) VVhat ground for that <hi>joy of Faith</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of, if the perſeverance of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful be not certain? Take away the Doctrine of <hi>perſeverance,</hi> and what becomes of Aſſurance? VVhat ground for that Aſſurance, which many of the Faithful (of whom we read in Scripture) had, and all are called on, to give Diligence to obtain, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. VVhen we read of the the <hi>full aſſurance of Hope,</hi> as attainable, as in the Texts laſt Cited?</p>
                  <p>And methinks, they which from that Caution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>[Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.]</hi> Infer, that he that ſtandeth may fall; they ſhould not deny, but from this Councel, and Exhortation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi>] This may be Inferred, that by giving Diligence, we may <hi>make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our Salvation. As that <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> Rom. 8.30. can never be broken, but one Link will Certainly, and Infallibly draw on another.</p>
                  <p>And ſo when we read of the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> which paſſeth all underſtanding, keeping the heart and mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. VVhen we read of the God of Hope, filling ſouls with <hi>joy and peace</hi> in Believing,

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain,</hi> as ſome would have it; then what ground can they have for <hi>ſuch an Hope,</hi> and <hi>ſuch Peace,</hi> and <hi>ſuch Joy,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks of? Rather it would be but like <hi>Jonah's Gourd,</hi> that ſprang up in a Night, and periſhed in a Night: VVould this afford <hi>ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> and <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſolation,</hi> to believe that they are <hi>Elect</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to day, but may be <hi>Reprobates</hi> to Morrow?

VVould this yield <hi>Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and ſuch Peace, as paſſeth underſtanding, to apprehend their <hi>Adoption</hi> to day, but to live in fear of their <hi>Abdication</hi> to Morrow?</p>
                  <p>Indeed if the Saints Perſeverance and Salvation depend on their mutable, <hi>Inconſtant will,</hi> not on Gods Purpoſe and Grace; Then how little hope is there of their Perſeverance, and Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? VVhile <hi>Innocent Adam</hi> being Tempted, was overcome; How much rather may the beſt of us conclude, that we ſhall fall by the <hi>hand of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter?</hi>
                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:152819:238"/>VVho of us all is fit to Encounter, and go out againſt this <hi>Goliah?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How little hope of the Perſeverance of any of the Faithful, if God hath no more promiſed to ſecure them from <hi>Total</hi> and <hi>Final</hi> Apoſtacy, than from common Slips, and Falls? VVhen there is ſcarce any probability, that we ſhould <hi>at all times do our Duty,</hi> but much to the contrary; that partly through the Remainders of Inbred Corruption, and partly through the Impetuouſneſs of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhould at one time or other grow Negligent; if, as we are letting go our Hold with God, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Lord ſhould <hi>let go his Hold</hi> of us; VVhat is like to become of us at laſt?</p>
                  <p>But ſhould we ſuppoſe the <hi>Scales to be even</hi> here, and that it is every way as likely, a Believer will never carry himſelf ſo, as might provoke the Lord to withdraw, and to leave him to himſelf, <hi>as that he will;</hi> yet it is plain, that to deny the certain Perſeverance of the Faithful, muſt needs <hi>Leſſen</hi> a Believers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. So his <hi>joy could not be full,</hi> no, not though he knew himſelf to be a true Believer. But admitting the <hi>certain perſeverance</hi> of the Faithful, a Believer that had but a probable perſwaſion, (and much more being aſſured of the Truth and Soundneſs of his Faith) might have <hi>more comfort</hi> for that. As Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath well Noted: <q>If I have <hi>no perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> either of my own ſincerity, or perſeverance, or yet of my perſeverance as certain, if I were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſincere, then I ſhould have <hi>two difficulties</hi> in the way of my comfort; which is more than one alone, and therefore muſt put me further off from comfort. But if I were ſure that all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhall perſevere, if I had withall but a
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:152819:239"/>
                        <hi>ſtrong hope,</hi> or probability that I am a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I ſhould freely receive the <hi>comfort</hi> of that probability, without the Impediment of farther doubts concerning perſeverance. When other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhould be thinking, what if I be Juſtified, yet how can I tell but I may loſe it by Back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But againſt the certain perſeverance of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, many things are Objected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. <hi>When the Righteous turneth away from his Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, that <hi>when a Righteous man doth</hi> turn away, or if he turneth away from his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſhall Die: But it is <hi>Propoſitio conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, quae nihil ponit in eſſe.</hi> An Hypothetical propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth only hold forth the Connexion as true. Not that the <hi>Antecedent</hi> ſhall, or may be: but if it ſhould be, then ſuch a thing would be <hi>conſequent</hi> upon it, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I go not away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter will not come.</hi> This will not prove, that it might have ſo fallen out, that Chriſt might not have departed. His going away was a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Determined, notwithſtanding his <hi>putting this Suppoſition.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven Preach any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi> This will <hi>not prove,</hi> that an Angel from Heaven ever ſhall, or may Preach another Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Do we not read of ſome that believe for a while, but in time of Temptation fall away? <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A <hi>Temporary Faith</hi> is not a <hi>true</hi> Faith. It is there ſaid of a Temporary believer, that he

And that <hi>his Seed remaineth in him,</hi> 1 John. 3.9. And it is Noted as the property of the good Ground, that it <hi>bringeth forth Fruit with patience,</hi> or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. That never was good Ground that only <hi>maketh a flouriſh</hi> for a time, but doth not bring forth Fruit to perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Do not <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29. Speak of a Total and Final Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy?</p>

                  <p n="4">4. It would ſeem that the Apoſtle does not ſpeak of <hi>true Believers,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5, 6.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is granted, ſome of theſe were in a ſtate of Grace, and yet fell Foulely; but not <hi>Totally,</hi> and <hi>Finally.</hi> They were worſted <hi>in praelio,</hi> loſt this and that Battel, and yet were on the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide <hi>in bello.</hi> As we read of <hi>Dan, A Troop ſhall overcome him; but he ſhall overcome at laſt.</hi> So however they were Foiled for ſome time, yet they overcame at laſt. Sometimes God ſuffereth his own Children to Fall, to make them more Humble, <hi>Cautelous,</hi> and Circumſpect ever after: That they ſtand more ſurely, and walk more ſteadily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Again, Some of thoſe mentioned, did fall quite away; but it cannot be proved, that ever they were <hi>true believers.</hi> The contrary is Intimated, when the Apoſtle ſubjoyneth that word of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Faithful, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having

As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath the like, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19, 20, 27. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: For if they had been of us, they would (no doubt) have continued with us.</hi> But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, (yea, by <hi>way of contradiſtinction</hi> to thoſe that went out, and fell off.) And <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>The anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: And even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in it.</hi> So that according to the Apoſtles Doctrine, if thoſe Apoſtates and Impoſtures, had ever <hi>received that Anointing,</hi> which true Believers have, they ſhould then have <hi>abode</hi> in the Truth, and not have proved ſuch wretched Apoſtates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object,</hi> 5. If the perſeverance of the Faithful be ſo certainly Determined, then all <hi>Exhortations</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> to Perſeverance, and all Threatnings in caſe of Apoſtacy, are needleſs, if not abſurd.

                  <p n="2">2. It is poſſible, that ſome may abuſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Saints perſeverance, to ſloth and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but that is the <hi>fault of men,</hi> not of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> So many did, and do abuſe the Doctrine of Free-grace, and Juſtification by Chriſts <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> without the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. which muſt not therefore be rejected, as falſe and dangerous Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the Doctrine of the Saints perſeverance is ſo far from Teaching, or <hi>encouraging to Security,</hi> that we cannot hold it, but we muſt hold our ſelves condemned by it, if we <hi>give</hi> up our ſelves to <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Indeed it tends to beget in the Saints an <hi>holy Confidence,</hi> not a <hi>ſinful Security.</hi> If I hold, that a Regenerate man does <hi>never fall Totally</hi> from Grace, then I muſt needs conclude, I cannot fall <hi>totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Security;</hi> or fall into any ſin, ſo as to be wholly under the power of it, and yet be a Regenerate man. Theſe two are <hi>purely Inconſiſtent.</hi> To fall totally under the power of Security, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reigning ſin, is to fall totally from God, and from Grace. So again, If I believe that all ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts ſhall continue in Gods fear, how can I hope, that I was ever a ſound Convert, if I <hi>caſt off his</hi> fear? Or if I have a certain perſwaſion, that I ſhall be ſaved, then I as little doubt of my <hi>continuing in</hi> the way to Heaven even to the end, as of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Heaven at laſt: <hi>And every man that hath

                  <p n="4">4. The Apoſtles Doctrine and Practice, both <hi>cuts off this</hi> Objection. As for his Doctrine, he telleth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The Gifts and Calling of God,</hi> (underſtand ſuch as flow from Election, ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>are without Repentance.</hi> Yet in the ſame Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. gives this Caution and Counſel: <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by Faith.</hi> Be not <hi>high minded, but fear.</hi> Indeed the Doctrine of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance doth not <hi>befriend</hi> Carnal ſecurity; nor the duty of an holy fear, <hi>Croſs</hi> and Thwart the Doctrine of Perſeverance: <hi>[Be not high minded, but fear.]</hi> Not that the Apoſtle commendeth <hi>doubting,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in Chriſtians: he only oppoſeth <hi>Security,</hi> and <hi>Self-confidence.</hi> Chriſtians may have an <hi>humble ſenſe</hi> of their own Weakneſs, and Inſufficiency, and withal an <hi>holy confidence</hi> in Gods Power, and Faithfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, where the Apoſtle encourageth the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the very Faithfulneſs of God to expect a good <hi>Iſſue,</hi> whatever Temptations they are put to encounter; yet at the ſame time he warneth them <hi>[Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.]</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>And as to his own <hi>practice,</hi> though none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but he was fully perſwaded of his own perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, yet this had <hi>no ſuch effect</hi> as to make him Remiſs and Careleſs. See the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is an <hi>Anxious</hi> fear, and there is a <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> fear. 1.

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:152819:243"/>he is freed from this fear. 2. A <hi>Cautious fear,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch an apprehenſion of the evil of Apoſtacy, as puts the ſoul upon an <hi>holy care</hi> to ſhun it: And this is a means of preſerving the Faithful. Now this is contrary to <hi>ſecurity.</hi> Therefore the Doctrine of the certain Perſeverance of the Faithful is not a Doctrine of Security. We (with the Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.) Teach it is promoted by ſuch means, as are very <hi>oppoſite</hi> to ſecurity. And further, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will grant them: <q>That it is not (at leaſt by any ordinary means) <hi>to be expected</hi> in this life, that the knowledge of our Sincerity, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Perſeverance ſhould be <hi>ſo perfect</hi> as to have no degree of Doubting, Habitual or Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, at one time or other. Seeing therefore we are all <hi>Imperfect</hi> in our certainty of our Sincerity and Perſeverance; it's meet and requiſite that we be called on to (and ſo that we keep up) a <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal working,</hi> preventing fear, according to the meaſure of our uncertainty.</q>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. PROP. XX. <hi>The Covenant of Grace is the beſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOt but that the Covenant of Works was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>in its kind,</hi> and moſt exactly fitted to that State, wherein Man was Created. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required nothing but what was <hi>mans Duty,</hi> as he was His Creature. Required nothing, but what man was able to perform. And promiſed all that man could deſire. As perfect <hi>perpetual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> was required of Man in the Covenant of Works; ſo perfect and <hi>perpetual Happineſs</hi> was promiſed thereupon. Thus the Covenant of works did excellently Comport with the ſtate of Man in Innocency.</p>
                  <p>But then the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> only can be to Mans advantage, in his fallen Eſtate. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is the beſt Covenant <hi>for us</hi> ſinners. It is impoſſible, that ſinners ſhould have Relief, and Benefit by the Covenant of Works. Indeed it may be beneficial unto ſinners, <hi>Occaſionally, Indirectly,</hi> that is, ſhewing our Miſery by ſin, that hereby we are fallen ſhort of Glory and Happineſs, laid under the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Obnoxious to Gods Wrath, and ſubject to Death Temporal, and Eternal. Thus it is true, the Covenant of Works may be an <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening our Conſciences, ſhewing what loſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:152819:246"/>we are, ſhould we ſtick to that Covenant, and if no other way be found out, but we muſt <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> by the ſentence of that Covenant. And thus it may ſome way prepare ſinners to accept of the Covenant of Grace, propounded and held forth. As the <hi>Iſraelites Bondage</hi> under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-Maſters ſhould have prepared them to hearken to, and welcome <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were ſent about their <hi>Deliverance, Exod.</hi> 4.31. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, all the benefit ſinners can have this way from the Covenant of Works, is only <hi>upon ſuppoſition</hi> of a Covenant of Grace, provided to relieve them from the ſtrict Sentence of that other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>That ſinners can have no benefit <hi>Properly,</hi> and <hi>Directly</hi> from the Covenant of Works, (which makes againſt them) but only from the Covenant of Grace, framed on purpoſe for ſinners Relief.</p>
                  <p>And that the Covenant of Grace is beſt for us: Appeareth thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The Covenant of Works was for the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> and Continuation of Mans Happineſs: But it ſpeaketh not to his preſent caſe, being now ſinful and miſerable, whereas the Covenant of Grace was provided for his Recovery: <hi>Poſt naufragium tabula,</hi> a Plank after Shipwrack. The Covenant of Grace holds forth the way of Mans Reſtitution and Reſtauration to Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Condition of the Covenant of Works, is utterly Impoſſible to ſinners. To be a ſinner, and to be perfectly Conformable to the Will and Law of God; to be a ſinner, and not to be a ſinner; is a <hi>plain Contradiction:</hi> It is impoſſible, <hi>Quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt infectum fieri.</hi> But the Condition of the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:152819:247"/>Covenant of Grace is poſſible, and attainable; yea, eaſily in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But do not many Divines ſay, That it is as poſſible for a man to keep the Law <hi>perfectly,</hi> as heartily to accept of Chriſt upon the Terms of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such Expreſſions muſt not be taken <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and Rigorouſly, but with a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For it is ſimply, and <hi>naturally impoſſible,</hi> that a ſinner ſhould be perfectly Conformed to Gods Law: But it is not <hi>naturally impoſſible</hi> that a ſinner ſhould Repent, and ſhould come to Obey from the Heart.</p>
                  <p>True, (as I have proved before) none ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods <hi>Special Grace;</hi> yet that any, who are called on to Repent, and Believe, do it not, they can only blame themſelves: The hindrance is <hi>in their Wills.</hi> They might come to Chriſt if they would. As Mr.
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Ball</hi> ſays: <q>The Invitation of God is not ſo hard, that Man cannot fulfill it, if he would: But ſuch as if Man would, he could not but Execute.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sinner, How it it? Art thou unſeignedly willing to leave thy ſins, that would Ruine thee for ever? Art thou <hi>heartily willing</hi> to accept of Chriſt; as to be Redeemed and Saved, ſo to be Guided, Ruled, and Governed by him? This is the <hi>Sum</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. If thou art unwilling to this, certainly, thou <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy ſelf</hi> unworthy of Eternal Life, and ſhalt be Self-condemned. You ſee, they are no <hi>hard Terms,</hi> whereon Life and Happineſs is offered and promiſed in the Covenant of Grace. If you be but willing, <hi>truly willing,</hi> it is done. And if you be unwilling
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:152819:247"/>to abandon your Luſts, that would be your Death, and unwilling to give up your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, the only Redeemer, and an All-ſufficient Saviour; it is evident, your <hi>Deſtruction is of your ſelves,</hi> that you are <hi>left without excuſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The Covenant of Works requiring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Obedience every way perfect, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it, there was no proviſion of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> no place for a Mediator, when God made that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with man. The Covenant of Works own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch thing, as <hi>Acceptation</hi> through, and for the Righteouſneſs of another. But the Covenant of Grace does admit of, and <hi>hold forth a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> According to the Covenant of Grace, we may be Juſtified and Saved for the Righteouſneſs of another, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> when it was impoſſible that we ſhould be Juſtified, and Saved by our own Righteouſneſs, And the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt (God-man) which is made over to a believing ſinner for his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a more excellent Righteouſneſs, than that of any meer Creature.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The Covenant of Works holds forth no ſuch thing, <hi>as Pardon.</hi> Abſolute perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being (as I ſaid) the Condition of it, upon the leaſt ſin, that Covenant was <hi>Irreparably broken.</hi> But the Covenant of Grace accepting of ſincere Obedience, and requiring no more <hi>as its Condition,</hi> granteth out a Pardon to thoſe, whoſe ſins are not Inconſiſtent with <hi>Sincerity.</hi> And ſo this Covenant is capable of Renewing. Waſt thou not obliged to forſake ſin, and to give up thy ſelf to Chriſt, and his Service, by thy very Baptiſm? But alas, Haſt thou not <hi>broken</hi> thy <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> Covenant?
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:152819:248"/>Yea, Haſt thou not lived long in the breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? And yet if at laſt thou wouldſt Repent, and come in to Chriſt, thou ſhouldſt be pardoned, and accepted.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Man might <hi>keep the Condition</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works for a time, and yet afterwards fall off, and loſe all. God Created Man at firſt in <hi>a ſtate of Integrity,</hi> with ſufficient ability to Obey perfectly if he would; but did not then <hi>think meet</hi> to Engage, and Undertake for him, that his will ſhould be ever to Obey. But ſuch as come up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, ſtand ſafe, are upon ſurer ground than <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. Their <hi>Perſeverance</hi> is certain; and as their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is certain, ſo their Salvation, and Happineſs. Thus get within the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and you are Lodged ſafe indeed.</p>
                  <p>Now,

                     </label> 1. Here take Notice of the <hi>Riches</hi> of Divine Grace and Mercy. When man had once broken Covenant with God, one would have thought, the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> ſhould have been ſo Incenſed againſt him for it, as never more to have dealt with man in this way; or if He did make another Covenant with man, it ſhould have been upon <hi>harder Terms:</hi> Yet behold, and wonder, from mans breach of the Covenant of works, he <hi>takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to manifeſt more of his Grace, in making another Covenant more to his Creatures <hi>advantage,</hi> when man might rather have concluded, that he would caſt off for ever, and would be <hi>favourable</hi> no more. Is this the manner of man, O Lord God? If a man find his Enemy, will he let him <hi>go well away</hi> out of his hand? God dealt not ſo with the Angels that fell, as he hath done with ſinful men.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:152819:248"/>2. See here the groſs Ignorance, Folly, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Self-juſtitiaries.</hi> Such as adhere to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and hope to be ſaved by their works, ſlighting and contemning Chriſt, and Grace offered. They that ſay to the works of their hands, <hi>ye are our Saviours:</hi> And ſay, we are Lords, we will not come to thee. Surely, they are miſerable, fooliſh Creatures, they know not <hi>what is good</hi> for themſelves, that go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, rejecting Chriſt, and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Theſe truſt to a <hi>broken reed:</hi> To turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from Chriſt, to relie on ones own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is to build on the Sand, <hi>not on the Rock:</hi> Or as if a man leaned his hand on a Wall, and a Serpent bit him. Indeed better no hope, than <hi>falſe hope;</hi> Better no confidence, than Carnal confidence. It is better to have no peace, than that which is falſe. A <hi>lying refuge</hi> will at laſt prove no Refuge, will be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, but the Confuſion of thoſe that put their truſt in it. I ſhould have far greater hopes of one that is low in Self-deſpair, than of one that is highly Confident in himſelf.</p>

And ſo much it ſeemeth was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: As the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman could ſay, <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:152819:249"/>4.25. <hi>I know that Meſſias cometh, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> No wonder that the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel hath <hi>more ſight,</hi> ſince the Sun is Riſen. Chriſt was <hi>darkly ſhadowed out</hi> under the Old Teſtament, but is clearly Revealed in the New. <hi>Moſes</hi> was vailed, and an hard thing it was for the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>look to the end</hi> of that which is Aboliſhed, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.) Chriſtians have the Advantage clear of thoſe that Lived before Chriſt. So that what the Prophets foretold, we may have a <hi>clearer</hi> underſtanding of, than they had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As we read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That not unto themſelves, but unto us, they did Miniſter the things that are now reported.</hi> We may ſee thoſe things that many Prophets, and Kings, and Righteous men heretofore could not ſee, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24.) We may <hi>know Chriſt in his Offices,</hi> and ſpecial Undertaking, and his ſaving Benefits, of which they knew very little. Types are beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the preſence, and coming of the <hi>Antitype.</hi> So Chriſtians may underſtand the ſcope and meaning of the Legal ſacrifices, and other <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt, better than the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did. Yea, it is a wonder, if any of us now ſhould be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Chriſt, and the Way of Salvation by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt;</hi> ſuch whoſe eyes the God of this World hath blinded.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould we think of ſuch as enjoy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and yet are Ignorant of Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him? Muſt it not needs be <hi>affected Ignorance?</hi> Muſt it not be <hi>wilful</hi> Blindneſs, if not <hi>judicial</hi> too? Indeed, they that like not to receive the Truth in Love, that they might be ſaved, may
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:152819:250"/>juſtly be <hi>given up to Satan,</hi> to be further blinded, and deceived by him. That as the Philiſtines dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſo ſhould he deal with them, even <hi>put out their eyes,</hi> blind their minds, leſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into them. Do not ſuch <hi>forfeit their eyes,</hi> who will not ſee the things that belong unto their peace? As it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. (A Text that is Cited no leſs than ſix times in the New Teſtament.) Hear ye in hearing, (hear as much as ye will) but underſtand not: q.d. <hi>In ſummâ rerum abundantia peribitis ſame.</hi> (As Occolump.)</p>
                  <p>The New Covenant of Grace holdeth forth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Happineſs more <hi>clearly</hi> than the Old. What was more darkly propounded, and promiſed in the Old Teſtament, is <hi>brought to Light,</hi> and more plainly diſcovered, and offered in the New. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Life and Immortality, is brought to Light, through the Goſpel.</hi> Thus New Teſtament-promiſes are better Promiſes: Though not <hi>better for the Matter</hi> of them, yet better for the manner of propounding them. The Church of God of old, for a long time (even from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>) had but one noted Promiſe, that we read of, to Live upon; and that very Dark and Myſterious too, <hi>[The Seed of the Woman, ſhall break the Serpents head]</hi> And the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had Spiritual, and <hi>Heavenly things</hi> promiſed more Darkly, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out under Earthly things; as Heaven was ſhadowed out under <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Promiſe. The way unto the Holieſt was not ſo manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. But we have <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Under the Old Teſtament, God required <hi>a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of Outward ſervices. Many <hi>Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had, which ſtood in Meats and Drinks, and diverſe Waſhings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. And many of thoſe Services were <hi>Coſtly,</hi> as the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of Sheep, and Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome of them <hi>painful,</hi> as Circumciſion, and going up from the Remoteſt parts of the Land, to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thrice a Year, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. The <hi>poſitive Inſtitutions</hi> under the Goſpel are very few, and thoſe very plain, and eaſie. <hi>Chriſts Yoke is very eaſie,</hi> compared with <hi>Moſes yoke.</hi>
                  </p>

The Goſpel-Diſpenſation of the Covenant is the beſt Diſpenſation, in regard of <hi>Power and Efficacy</hi> accompanying it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11. The Spirit was given more <hi>ſparingly</hi> to thoſe under the Old Teſtament, but is <hi>poured out</hi> more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Times of the Goſpel.

                  <p>Others have the like Pretence for caſting off Goſpel-Ordinances, as when we urge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. to prove, that the Lords Supper, is to <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> in the Church: (And if that, why not other Ordinances Inſtituted by the ſame Author?) <hi>Till he come.</hi> To this ſome ſay, He is come to them in the Spirit; and being <hi>come in the Spirit,</hi> ſuch Ordinances are out of Date.

                     <hi>coming in the Spirit?</hi> Will it not hence follow, that the Lords Supper was Inſtituted for none but Unbelievers, Carnal, unregenerate Perſons, ſuch as <hi>have not the Spirit?</hi> If they that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, have no more to do with this Ordinance, then we muſt ſay, it was never intended, as <hi>a Feaſt for</hi> Chriſt Friends: But for ſuch as are none of his, (as, if any man <hi>have not the Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, he is none of his.)</p>
                  <p>Again it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom Chriſt was <hi>come in the Spirit,</hi> did yet continue to hold Communion in this, and other Ordinances.

                  <p>Therefore we are to underſtand another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, to be meant in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.

In theſe Laſt days of the Goſpel, God hath poured out of his Spirit, as we ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17.

                  <p>And then, that the Lord hath kept the <hi>beſt to the last</hi> for us, that we have been brought forth under the laſt and <hi>best Diſpenſation</hi> of the Covenant, it ſhould teach us to acknowledge his Exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace to Us-ward. It was not becauſe we were <hi>better</hi> than others that went before, that we have been thus Priviledged above others. No, we were <hi>by Nature the Children of Wrath,</hi> even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Our Father as an <hi>Amorite,</hi> our Mother as an <hi>Hittite,</hi> and We as the Children of the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> before God. Yet the Myſtery which <hi>was hid from Ages,</hi> and Generations, is made manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, to whom God would make known the Riches of his glorious Grace.

VVe that Live under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged far above thoſe that <hi>went before;</hi> not only ſuch as were altogether ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to the Covenants of Promiſe, but even ſuch as were taken into Covenant under the Old Teſtament-Diſpenſation, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.11.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:152819:254"/>with <hi>Luke</hi> 7.28. <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry is preferred to that of the Prophets, as clearer; and the <hi>Goſpel-Ministry</hi> preſerred unto <hi>Johns,</hi> as clearer ſtill. So it is a greater Priviledge and advantage (if men would Improve it) to enjoy a Goſpel-Miniſtry, than to have ſat at <hi>Moſes</hi> feet, or to have heard of any of the Prophets of Old.</p>
                  <p>But a word more: As we Live under a better Diſpenſation, ſhould not we indeavour to <hi>be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> As we have greater means, ſhould we not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more in Grace and Knowledge?
